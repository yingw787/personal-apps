I recently had the privilege of writing for [Built In's](https://builtin.com/)
[Expert Contributor Network](https://builtin.com/contributors), and just
published my first post there. It chronicles my experience over the past one and
a half months struggling with DevOps, which I discussed in more detail in my
TinyDevCRM hourly logs.

You can see the post
[here](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/devops-aws).

I enjoyed the experience of working with Built In's content editors, and I
noticed an improvement in the quality and direction of my writing. I look
forward to working with them in the future :smile:
