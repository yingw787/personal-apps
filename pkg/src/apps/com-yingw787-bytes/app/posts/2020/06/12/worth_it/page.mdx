I wrote an article for [Built In's Expert Contributor
Network](https://builtin.com/expert-contributors) and published my third post,
on services I've found that make the cloud worth it. This post discusses some
cloud-native services I think are worth using if restrictions on optionality
between clouds are relaxed.
