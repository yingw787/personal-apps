import { ArticleLayout } from "@libs/blog/components/article-layout";

export const article = {

  title: "Postgres, as an App! (Now with one-click deploys to AWS + Heroku!)",
  description:
    "Postgres, as an App! (Now with one-click deploys to AWS + Heroku!)",

Me saying ["use Postgres as an app"](/posts/2020/06/15/postgres_as_app_1) is
fine, but without shipping anything it doesn't do anyone much good. So let's
ship!

## First, the code

Here's [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/yingw787/postgres_as_app)
complementing this blog post. Clone the repository, set up the system
requirements, and follow the instructions in the README.
