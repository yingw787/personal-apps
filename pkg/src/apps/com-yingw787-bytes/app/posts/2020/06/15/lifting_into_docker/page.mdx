You could say this is a continuation of [my experiment using Docker as a server
for development workflows](/posts/2020/02/27/docker_as_vagrant). In the end
though, I've found deployments to production in AWS to be far more complex than
that model allowed, and I ended up using a more conventional model of
`docker-compose` to model systems locally and to build Dockerfile images to ship
to the remote Docker registries.

In contrast, I've been using an adjusted version of the prior workflow to
develop my frontends. This is mostly due to my usage of `hugo`, the static
website generator. I double-checked CloudFront and I have something like 15
different `hugo` bundles in production right now, created at different times.
The problem is that `hugo` is still primarily a work-in-progress project, and
there are breaking changes made between different `hugo` versions. This impacts
changes between versions of different `hugo` themes. I've encountered this
difficulty when upgrading dependency versions for my personal blog. I already
had to request help from the maintainer, [Munif
Tanjim](https://muniftanjim.com/), who very graciously walked me through the
upgrade process and even created some diffs himself. I felt embarrassed that I
needed help doing that, and I didn't really want to go through that experience
again when creating [TinyDevCRM's documentation](https://docs.tinydevcrm.com).

When I was working with Docker for TinyDevCRM I learned of command `exec "@"`,
which if set as the Dockerfile `CMD`, allows you to pipe in a command to run at
runtime. Combined with having its own independent build process, you can lock
into place a set of fixed dependencies that version separately from your other
projects.

---

Let's walk through a project to see what I mean.

1.  Install the following system dependencies:

    `docker`, I'm using:

    ```shell
    $ docker version
    Docker version 19.03.8, build afacb8b7f0
    ```

    `make`, I'm using:

    ```shell
    $ make version
    GNU Make 4.2.1
    Built for x86_64-pc-linux-gnu
    Copyright (C) 1988-2016 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
    License GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later <http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html>
    This is free software: you are free to change and redistribute it.
    There is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
    ```

2.  Create a directory with the following files:

    ```shell
    $ cd /path/to/dir
    $ tree .
    .
    ├── Dockerfile
    └── Makefile
    ```

3.  In your `Dockerfile`, add your base Docker image reference, labels, and
    other build arguments:

    ```docker
    FROM debian:buster-20200514
    LABEL maintainer="me@yingw787.com"

    # Set build arguments.
    ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
    ```

4.  In your `Dockerfile`, update package archives and download `curl`. Note that
    updating package archives does not update system dependencies, and the
    container should still mirror the base image until dependencies are
    upgraded.

    ```docker
    # Get package lists, important for getting 'curl' and such.
    RUN apt-get -y update

    # Install build dependencies.
    RUN apt-get install -y curl
    ```

5.  In your `Dockerfile`, install your runtime dependencies. You can see why
    Golang took off for cloud-native development here; it's a single binary you
    need to `curl` for each app!

    ```docker
    # Install golang.
    RUN curl https://dl.google.com/go/go1.14.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz -o /tmp/go1.14.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    RUN tar -C /usr/local -xvzf /tmp/go1.14.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    ENV PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

    # Install hugo. It's important to lock down the version of `hugo` since it's
    # still a development version with breaking changes.
    #
    # Use '-L' to follow redirects from GitHub releases.
    RUN curl -L https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.62.0/hugo_0.62.0_Linux-64bit.deb -o /tmp/hugo_0.62.0_Linux-64bit.deb
    RUN dpkg -i /tmp/hugo_0.62.0_Linux-64bit.deb
    ```

6.  In your `Dockerfile`, set your default home directory and update directory
    permissions. I'm using '1000` as my user is the first non-root user on my
    system, as per [this forum
    answer](https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-general-1/what-is-the-user-1000-a-4175510196/).

    ```docker
    # Setup workdirectory.
    RUN mkdir /app
    WORKDIR /app

    # Setup permissions.
    RUN chown -R 1000:1000 /app
    ```

7.  In your `Dockerfile`, set your default command to run `exec "@"` in order to
    pass in commands at runtime:

    ```docker
    # Run commands.
    CMD [ "exec", "\"@\"" ]
    ```

The final `Dockerfile` should look something like this:

```docker
FROM debian:buster-20200514
LABEL maintainer="me@yingw787.com"

# Set build arguments.
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive

# Get package lists, important for getting 'curl' and such.
RUN apt-get -y update

# Install build dependencies.
RUN apt-get install -y curl

# Install golang.
RUN curl https://dl.google.com/go/go1.14.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz -o /tmp/go1.14.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
RUN tar -C /usr/local -xvzf /tmp/go1.14.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
ENV PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

# Install hugo. It's important to lock down the version of `hugo` since it's
# still a development version with breaking changes.
#
# Use '-L' to follow redirects from GitHub releases.
RUN curl -L https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/download/v0.62.0/hugo_0.62.0_Linux-64bit.deb -o /tmp/hugo_0.62.0_Linux-64bit.deb
RUN dpkg -i /tmp/hugo_0.62.0_Linux-64bit.deb

# Setup workdirectory.
RUN mkdir /app
WORKDIR /app

# Setup permissions.
RUN chown -R 1000:1000 /app

# Run commands.
CMD [ "exec", "\"@\"" ]
```

I use `make` and Makefiles in order to template out commands, as it's easier in
order to consistently pass in CLI arguments for `docker run`. It's also a bit
safer and transportable than using `bash`.

1.  In your `Makefile`, declare your enviroment variables. I'm declaring
    `AWS_PROFILE` for (omitted) CloudFormation lifecycle management,
    `APP_VERSION` for defining the Docker image version as the commit hash,
    `GIT_REPO_ROOT` to define the absolute path to the `git` repository root (I
    don't like relative paths), `DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME` for `docker` image name,
    `HUGO_PORT` to define which port on `localhost` I should expose this
    container on, and `USERID` / `GROUPID` to run the Docker container as a
    specific user and group (in order to keep directory resources under the same
    user/group to avoid `sudo`).

    `.PHONY` enforces a `make` target runs irrespective of the filesystem state.
    See [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2145605) for
    more details.

    ```make
    #!/usr/bin/env make

    .PHONY: version check setup run start

    export AWS_PROFILE ?= tinydevcrm-user
    export APP_VERSION ?= $(shell git rev-parse --short HEAD)
    export GIT_REPO_ROOT ?= $(shell git rev-parse --show-toplevel)

    export DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME ?= tinydevcrm-api-docs
    export HUGO_PORT ?= 1320

    export USERID ?= $(shell id -u $(whoami))
    export GROUPID ?= $(shell id -g $(whoami))
    ```

2.  In your `Makefile`, add a `setup` target in order to setup your repository
    after first cloning it. I'm downloading the `hugo` theme I need (if it
    doesn't exist), and installing `hugo` modules required by the `hugo` theme
    in order to run properly. Note how when I'm running `git clone` in the
    second step, I'm referencing the destination directory as
    _`/app/themes/docuapi`_, and not _`${GIT_REPO_ROOT}/themes/docuapi`_,
    because `/app` is my Docker container working directory `${WORKDIR}`. I'm
    downloading the dependency _within my Docker context_, even though through
    the usage of `-v $(GIT_REPO_ROOT):/app` it will still appear on my local
    directory, _as though I had cloned to my local system_.

    ```make
    # Use the custom fork, for styling purposes.
    setup:
        docker build \
            --file $(GIT_REPO_ROOT)/Dockerfile \
            --tag $(DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME):$(APP_VERSION) \
            $(GIT_REPO_ROOT)
        docker run \
            -v $(GIT_REPO_ROOT):/app \
            --net=host \
            -u $(USERID):$(GROUPID) \
            $(DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME):$(APP_VERSION) \
            git clone https://github.com/tinydevcrm/docuapi /app/themes/docuapi || true
        docker run \
            -v $(GIT_REPO_ROOT):/app \
            --net=host \
            -u $(USERID):$(GROUPID) \
            $(DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME):$(APP_VERSION) \
            hugo mod get -u
    ```

3.  In your `Makefile`, create the `run` target. This `run` target is nice
    because it lifts the command line arguments and inserts them directly into
    the `docker run` command, while still enabling things like `--net=host` for
    unifying the Docker network with my system network (ensuring `localhost` on
    Docker is `localhost` on system), connecting the Docker volumes together,
    and passing in any other flags (like passing in the aws config / credentials
    directory for usage of `awscli` within my Docker context using my system
    secrets) that I need in order to require as few dependencies on my system as
    possible.

    ```make
    # From: https://stackoverflow.com/a/14061796
    # If the first argument is "run"...
    ifeq (run,$(firstword $(MAKECMDGOALS)))
    # use the rest as arguments for "run"
    RUN_ARGS := $(wordlist 2,$(words $(MAKECMDGOALS)),$(MAKECMDGOALS))
    # ...and turn them into do-nothing targets
    $(eval $(RUN_ARGS):;@:)
    endif

    # Lifts command into `docker run` context.
    run:
        docker run \
            -v $(GIT_REPO_ROOT):/app \
            -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws \
            --net=host \
            -u $(USERID):$(GROUPID) \
            $(DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME):$(APP_VERSION) \
            $(RUN_ARGS)
    ```

4.  Add various other targets you may need to commonly reference. I templated
    out the `hugo server` command because I run `hugo server` often. This
    involves the usage of recursive `make` within the same file, which might not
    be the best way of doing things; would love to hear of a better way.
    Commands passed in here should be wrapped in double quotes, otherwise they
    might be interpreted as part of the `make` command instead of passed
    wholesale.

    ```make
    start: setup
        $(MAKE) run "hugo server -p $(HUGO_PORT)"
    ```

The final `Makefile` should look something like this:

```make
#!/usr/bin/env make

.PHONY: version check setup run start

export AWS_PROFILE ?= tinydevcrm-user
export APP_VERSION ?= $(shell git rev-parse --short HEAD)
export GIT_REPO_ROOT ?= $(shell git rev-parse --show-toplevel)

export DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME ?= tinydevcrm-api-docs
export HUGO_PORT ?= 1320

export USERID ?= $(shell id -u $(whoami))
export GROUPID ?= $(shell id -g $(whoami))

# Use the custom fork, for styling purposes.
setup:
    docker build \
        --file $(GIT_REPO_ROOT)/Dockerfile \
        --tag $(DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME):$(APP_VERSION) \
        $(GIT_REPO_ROOT)
    docker run \
        -v $(GIT_REPO_ROOT):/app \
        --net=host \
        -u $(USERID):$(GROUPID) \
        $(DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME):$(APP_VERSION) \
        git clone https://github.com/tinydevcrm/docuapi /app/themes/docuapi || true
    docker run \
        -v $(GIT_REPO_ROOT):/app \
        --net=host \
        -u $(USERID):$(GROUPID) \
        $(DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME):$(APP_VERSION) \
        hugo mod get -u

# From: https://stackoverflow.com/a/14061796
# If the first argument is "run"...
ifeq (run,$(firstword $(MAKECMDGOALS)))
  # use the rest as arguments for "run"
  RUN_ARGS := $(wordlist 2,$(words $(MAKECMDGOALS)),$(MAKECMDGOALS))
  # ...and turn them into do-nothing targets
  $(eval $(RUN_ARGS):;@:)
endif

# Lifts command into `docker run` context.
run:
    docker run \
        -v $(GIT_REPO_ROOT):/app \
        -v ~/.aws:/root/.aws \
        --net=host \
        -u $(USERID):$(GROUPID) \
        $(DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME):$(APP_VERSION) \
        $(RUN_ARGS)

start: setup
    $(MAKE) run "hugo server -p $(HUGO_PORT)"
```

This isn't a terribly large amount of work, and it's a lot easier than say,
using Bazel (which I had wanted to use for TinyDevCRM, but eventually decided
against after seeing just how much work building out my own source would
entail).

It's also useful for integrating debuggers and needing to expose a
process to a stdout stream. For example, running `python -m ipdb manage.py
runserver` for a Django process hits a `pdb` trace before starting the Django
process. This means without having a stdout stream available, either you can't
use `ipdb` or `pdb` within Docker, or you have to somehow elide that first `pdb`
trace and attach to the Docker process manually before adding a `pdb` trace and
hitting the server process with a request to see it. This is a comfortable third
option.

There's still problems with this stack; I usually use `Ctrl+C` in order to exit
the Docker container, resulting it merely stopping instead of deleting itself,
but otherwise it's not bad. I like to think it keeps the Haskell philosophy of
"lifting into structure", which I've found applicable outside of one programming
language.
