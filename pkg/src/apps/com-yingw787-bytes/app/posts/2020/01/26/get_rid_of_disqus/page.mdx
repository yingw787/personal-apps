I just found out yesterday that Disqus was *inserting advertisements into the
comments sections of my blogs*. I hadn't noticed since I use [uBlock
Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/) by default on desktop Firefox. I'm
also not sure whether I have recently reached a threshold of viewers, and now
fit some threshold of monetization. In any case, on Saturday, January 25th, 2020
at 11:54PM Eastern Time, I took [this full-window desktop
screenshot](/images/2020/01/26/screenshot.png) using [Firefox
Screenshots](https://screenshots.firefox.com/).

My sincere apologies to everybody reading this blog. I find this behavior from
Disqus to be a massive betrayal of trust. This blog has not been monetized and
never will be. Beyond monetization, the advertisements served by Disqus do not
align at all with this blog's purpose of technical education. Your trust in my
work here is my highest priority.

I typically do not make changes to this site that would break backwards
compatibility, but I have disabled comments for the entire site until further
notice. This change has taken effect Sunday, January 26th, at 12:21AM Eastern
Time. I will take some time to find a suitable FOSS replacement, but if none is
found, I will post backlinks to discussions I start on
[Lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs) and [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com)
on every post instead.
