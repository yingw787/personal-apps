**(Correction on 01/13/2020)**: Original version of this post mentioned that
"GNU `grep` ships as a standalone executable".
[**`lobste.rs`**](https://lobste.rs) user
[**`aufziehvogel`**](https://lobste.rs/u/aufziehvogel) pointed out that GNU
`grep` is actually a set of dynamically linked libraries, which both he and I
verified through `ldd`:

```bash
$ lsb_release -a
No LSB modules are available.
Distributor ID: Ubuntu
Description:    Ubuntu 19.10
Release:        19.10
Codename:       eoan
$ ldd /usr/bin/grep
        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007fffb6bfe000)
        libpcre.so.3 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpcre.so.3 (0x00007f7e078e8000)
        libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f7e078e2000)
        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f7e076f1000)
        libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f7e076ce000)
        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f7e079a5000)
```

Changed to say "a set of dynamically linked libraries, with a handful of
references in `/usr/bin` as `{grep, egrep, fgrep, rgrep}`".

**(Correction on 01/13/2020)**: Original version of this post mentioned "GNU
`grep`". [**`lobste.rs`**](https://lobste.rs) user
[**`zge`**](https://lobste.rs/u/zge) pointed out that while `grep` was released
1974, _GNU_ `grep` is much newer, being released during 1992, according to the
[authors file on
gnu.org](http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/grep.git/tree/AUTHORS). Changed 2
instances of "GNU `grep`" to "`grep`".

You know what's crazy? [`grep`](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/) was released
45 years ago. _45 years_. To put that into perspective, I Googled (or rather,
used DuckDuckGo) "headlines 1974", and apparently people were talking about,
among other things, Richard Nixon's resignation, Patty Hearst's kidnapping, and
Frank Sinatra's performance at Madison Square Garden.

I hate being the guy to say "the 90s started 30 years ago", so let's reframe
this discussion to avoid talking about how old we are. I've found that I love
old things, particularly _old tech_.

---

My family's first new car (in fact, probably my _lineage's_ first new car) is
a 2000 Honda Accord, that we still drive 20 years later. When I was growing up,
my dad never failed to point out the new cars and say how hard it was to change
the timing belt, or change the oil, or realign the tires, or some other
maintenance nightmare a random coworker might have shared in passing, all of
which he does himself. I remember during the Great Recession, when Pontiac went
out of business, a whole bunch of new Pontiacs were driving around because the
dealerships had fire sales. If I think about it, I don't see too many Pontiacs
these days, and those cars were a decade newer than my dad's. I still see the
occasional 2000 Honda Accord.

If I had to quantify this feeling, I might say it's a longing for _freedom_.
That which you choose, you own, you maintain, and you defend lends you your
dignity and your identity. There's this [great
article](http://www.startribune.com/for-tech-weary-midwest-farmers-40-year-old-tractors-now-a-hot-commodity/566737082/)
about farmers purchasing 40 year old John Deere tractors because newer tractors
require a subscription service to maintain them, and because the service could
have a 2 week long maintenance backlog, your crops could go bad if you didn't
harvest them at the right time. I'm sure the economics makes purchasing these
old tractors common sense. Lower prices and lower operational costs mean higher
profit, after all. But I'm sure the feeling of fear and humiliation of relying
on something you can't fix so you can feed your family engenders a strong
emotional attachment and appreciation for independence. At least, that's how I
would feel, and I [don't think I'm alone](https://repair.org).

When something is old, when it stands the test of time, it's a testament to the
care and love and thought a craftsman put into it. It's a legacy, like a tree
you plant for your kids. It's progress too! It feels us feel proud to be human,
more than just apes constantly reinventing the wheel. Like maybe if we can stack
one stone on another without the pile falling over, we could go places. I think
those are all good reasons to get out of bed in the morning.

So now that I've explained _why_ I'm so invested in makings things that last,
how exactly _do_ we make tech that ages well?

To me, tech that ages well:

- **stays simple in important ways**: `grep` ships as a set of dynamically
  linked libraries, with a handful of references in `/usr/bin` as `{grep,
egrep, fgrep, rgrep}`. Among other benefits, this may make it easier to
  instrument, to deploy and to permission. It also has an tightly scoped
  interface contract, with UNIX-based stdin/stdout/stderr, which means any
  programming language with shell compatibility can access it.

- **gets better with changing requirements**: Antifragile systems become
  stronger when faced with adversity. I love the concept of antifragility as
  an improvement over mere resiliency, and I'm looking forward to adding it to
  my common vernacular.

  The humble [barcode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Product_Code),
  first used in 1974 to scan a pack of chewing gum, takes up minimal packaging
  surface area, can be printed / faxed / scanned without losing fidelity, and
  remains tolerant to manufacturing defects using error correction codes,
  suboptimal scanning orientations using odd/even parity, and technology
  changes like OSes or encodings by defining your own encoding associativity.

  This is all already pretty great, but the nice part about starting with a
  sparse encoding is that you can compress it. For smaller packages, and given
  tighter manufacturing tolerance guarantees, you can take a UPC-A barcode and
  physically shrink it into a UPC-E barcode by removing certain digits:

  [upc](/images/2020/01/13/50years_1.png)

  These are the same barcode, and yet one has maybe half the surface area of
  the other one. I can see how this can be helpful. You might also notice that
  the images aren't scaled properly and suffer from significant artifacting,
  but that if you were to scan them, they'd probably still generate the proper
  product code. You could say this is a strict improvement, as the tradeoff
  between UPC-A and UPC-E is the number of possible product codes vs. space,
  and not say fault tolerance vs. space, and there are ways to work around
  limited product codes.

- **Fill a required niche better than anything else**: I might get burned for
  this, but I'd say JavaScript isn't at all as bad as some might say it is. We
  all like to [poke fun at it](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat),
  mostly because of its properties or lack thereof, but then we consider the
  alternatives for client-side applications. [Adobe
  Flash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash_Player)? [Microsoft
  Silverlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Silverlight)? [Java
  applets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet)?
  [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly) might be the only
  native alternative to JavaScript for rich content these days, and even then
  it's impractical for most basic JS tasks, which may comprise the vast
  majority of the open Internet.

  For something to age well, people have to _need_ it. Only the code that
  ships matters, and without people needing it, nobody _cares_ about what
  you've shipped. There's two positives from this. When you're first starting
  off, you enjoy a great deal of flexibility in implementation, and when
  you're big, you can dump loads of money into making something "bad" usable.
  JavaScript happens to satisfy a multi-billion dollar "niche". So I reckon
  we'll see ES60 or something ridiculous 50 years from now.

  You know, after writing this, maybe I should have referred to the [Intel
  8086](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8086) and [the x86
  ISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86) as an example of something that's
  sticky. Oh well.

I may or may not be working on some personal projects this year that I intend on
using for myself. One thing I _know_ I can't do for my personal projects is
constantly dedicate time to working on it after I've "shipped". I want to build
something once, and ideally use it for the rest of my life (or maybe 20-50 years
to start off) without having to worry about having to update something or other
or risk losing something important down the line. So thinking about what
properties makes software age well is helpful for me in terms of deciding what
fundamental technologies (e.g. SQL or REST) I want to incorporate into a system
design, and perhaps as equally important, what things I'm willing to trade away.
