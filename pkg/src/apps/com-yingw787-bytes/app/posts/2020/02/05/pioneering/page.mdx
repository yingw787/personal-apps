I _love_ process.

I rely on process because I don't like remembering things. I don't like having
the additional cognitive load required to having to remember things, and
burdening myself with the fear of forgetting them. I also like building
products, and in a way, you could define products as things that don't need you
in the loop to sell themselves (as opposed to say consulting). And I like process
because talking about process leads to investment in a system where everybody
can benefit, which could reduce friction, increase alignment, and dampen
negative human influences.

Process is progress. Since it's based on hard metrics, you have some
understanding of the underlying truth around what you're measuring. Since you
only need to invest a small amount of willpower to update the process, you can
rely on rote routine to do things instead of having to constantly think about
things. All this continues to bring me great joy, that I can stop focusing on
the little things and focus on the big things.

Yeah, the big things. Process isn't so great in a lot of important areas,
especially when it comes to first starting out and proving an idea works, and
when you conquently need the flexibility to do things that process explicitly
denies. It also fails when it ages and the reasoning behind it is lost;
unreasonable process is beaucracy, which isn't much fun. And process isn't good
at innovation; a good process leads to a faster horse, not a car. I've
experienced all these blind spots in one way or another, and it smarts.

I think a good engineer learns to balance when to pioneer and when to apply
process. Oliver Eidel wrote [a great blog post about pioneers vs. process
people](https://www.eidel.io/2020/01/31/pioneers-vs-process-people/), which to
me demonstrated the potential of blending these two strengths together to create
a great product.

I've never created a product (or a framework or an open-source tool), and after
reading technical books and maintaining a technical blog and working in industry
for a few years, I think something like this is the next Rubicon I should aim to
cross. So I've been spending the past week or so working on a proof of concept
for an open-source project I've been wanting to build, and I'm pleased to say
that I've finished the MVP, [located here on
GitHub](https://github.com/yingw787/tinydevcrm-mvp).

I'll make another blog post right after this one to discuss said project. For
now, I want to talk about how I pioneered this as a process person:

- **Tunnel all the way to the end**: What I wanted to prove out in the proof
  of concept was mere technical feasibility. For me, that required a massive
  expenditure of willpower, even though the proof of concept is honestly quite
  simple. Once I can see the light at the end of the tunnel though, I have no
  problems widening that tunnel so that cars can pass through. This is how I
  delineate between pioneering and process.

- **Write tickets to focus**: I use [Basecamp
  Personal](https://basecamp.com/personal), and I can say without it or a
  similar kind of easy-to-use issue tracker, I wouldn't have finished the
  barebones MVP. Describing to myself what I wanted to build, and having a
  ladder of todo items to check off, remains tremendously comforting to me. I
  can see where I'm going. Apply process to pioneer when you can.

- **Keep momentum up any way you can**: Write specs you know you won't follow.
  Issue empty updates to people who may or may not be listening. Add in more
  comments or move code around the project aimlessly when you're first getting
  started. Do anything you can to avoid giving up, since the most important
  thing to getting this done is to make sure there's no "zero days". As long
  as progress isn't zero, it will take a finite amount of time to finish.

I think the more I pioneer, the more getting started will become easier.
