**(Update on 01/30/2020)**: I now have [a slightly better understanding of
Haskell](/posts/2020/01/30/a_review_of_haskell), and I agree that much of this
tutorial doesn't do true monads justice. This [advice from Stephen
Diehl](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/#eightfold-path-to-monad-satori) rings
true for me today, and I think it is worth mentioning here:

Much of this information comes from
[Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9-y-6csu5WGm29I7JiwpnA) and
[their video on monads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1e8gqXLbsU). I found
their videos extraordinarily beginner-friendly and understandable. Highly
recommend you to check them out :smile:

I would also like to give a big shoutout to [Jason
DeLaat](https://bitbucket.org/%7Be3e424c7-ef48-4816-bf9d-412cfc59c86c%7D/) for
building the
[**`pymonad`**](https://bitbucket.org/jason_delaat/pymonad/src/master/) project.
I had a hard time mentally converting some principles from Haskell to Python and
his project helped me gain a far better understanding than I would have on my
own.

---

I've been scared of monads ever since I first heard of them. So many references
to burritos, or nuclear waste containers, or some other analogy that didn't make
sense to me. So if you're scared of monads too, maybe my take on what a monad is
will help.

_A monad is a [data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type) (e.g. `int`)
that encapsulates some [control
flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow) (e.g. `try/catch`)_.

See? Not too bad.

---

The natural thing to ask afterwards would be, _why are monads important to
understand_?

From my experience working in the software industry, I'm amazed at how much of
success at doing something involves just doing that something and not failing at
it, and _just how hard it is to not fail at it_. Things that aren't complicated
when codebases are small (e.g. error model design and management) become
intractably difficult as codebases scale.

For example, here are three things you may encounter when writing code at work:

- Conditional statements (like `if/else`)

- Error handling

- Return values of different types

They seem trivial enough to execute on, but given the right context, may involve
a good deal of reasoning to ensure correctness for all cases.

Let's go ahead and implement division, in Python 3.7:

```python
def div(a, b):
    return a / b
```

Seems straightforward enough for happy path inputs:

```python
>>> def div(a, b):
...     return a / b
...
>>> div(4, 2)
2.0
>>> type(div(4, 2))
<type 'float'>
>>>
```

But what happens if you divide by zero? This is a possibility you may face if
you don't pre-process your input. If you want to maintain separation of
concerns, your method really shouldn't compose any pre-processing logic under
the interface layer. Otherwise, you might duplicate pieces of your validation
logic in different portions of your codebase, and multiple implementations of
validation logic may make satisfying _any_ specification and quickly iterating
on that specification according to business requirements much more difficult.

And of course, if you have a pre-processing layer between your data retrieval
layer and this method, it might not be implemented correctly, or you might be
using a library that doesn't control pre-processing at a fine enough
granularity, and bad inputs might get through. You can fix a broken service or
executable of course, but until it's fixed, it may break production and cause
downtime or data loss.

So formally speaking, if your input `b` is of the set of all integers, this
situation may occur:

```python
>>> def div(a, b):
...     return a / b
...
>>> div(5, 0)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in div
ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
>>>
```

If you want your method to play nice with others, you really can't just raise a
`ZeroDivisionError` and halt execution whenever you get a "bad" input, and
panic for help from the user. For one thing, there may not be a human user-agent
available, if the code exists as part of an automated service. If your service
fails, this may cause the rest of the service stack to start failing, and force
all affected developers to comb through logs and such to find the root cause.
Furthermore, you may not always have some other parent service that can handle
propagated errors, or you are building the parent service handling propagated
errors from others, and you cannot afford to "fail fast". Maybe you are
currently processing some chunk of data and if you fail in processing a subset
of that chunk, you have to throw away the entire chunk, and the time it took to
process the rest of that chunk.

Okay, so let's add the ability to gracefully handle exceptions so as to not
terminate program execution. However, adding graceful handling logic can get
messy really quickly:

```python
def div(a, b):
    try:
        return a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        pass # WHAT TO DO HERE??
    # General catch-all for unhandled
    # edge cases
    except Exception as err:
        raise err
```

For one, you could be raising any number of exception types within that method
(e.g. an exception that could be raised at any time within client processes is
[**`KeyboardInterrupt`**](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#KeyboardInterrupt)).
This would lead to many different `except` clauses, which would expand your
try/catch block (and [SLOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_lines_of_code))
with respect to the number of exception types you want to catch. Second, if you
apply exception handling as part of any mainline program execution, you lose the
ability to accurately trace any exceptions from the handling logic and before.
This stings, especially for a language like Python that explicitly trades off
performance for clean stack traces.

So what do you do? You can't return an integer, because not only is that
mathematically undefined and impossible, there are no sane integer defaults
because any integer on the number line could be another valid result of two
inputs for this method. If `b` was 1, `div(a, 1)` would return `a` where `a` is
of the set of all integers).

Maybe you can try returning a value of a different type (say `NoneType`)
instead:

```python
def div(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return None
    return a / b
```

Well that takes care of that problem, right?

```python
>>> def div(a, b):
...     if b == 0:
...         return None
...     return a / b
...
>>> div(5, 0)
>>> type(div(5, 0))
<type 'NoneType'>
```

Not quite. Type `NoneType` does not have the same attributes as type `int`,
which may result in errors down the line if you are
[duck-typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing), which dynamically
typed languages like Python allow and encourage:

```python
>>> None + 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'
>>>
```

So if you were using this definition of division in another program, you risk
cascading the failure downstream. Let's say you were implementing a basic
map/reduce operation over some arbitrary data:

```python
>>> mylist = [0, 1, 2, 3]
>>> def mapper(n):
...     return div(5, n)
...
>>> map(mapper, mylist)
[None, 5, 2, 1]
>>> def reducer(a, b):
...     return a + b
...
>>> reduce(reducer, map(mapper, mylist))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in reducer
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'
>>>
```

Note that the stack trace has absolutely nothing to do with the map/reduce
operation, which is implemented correctly, but rather with the underlying
implementation of the `div()` method. Not only does this prevent effective
pipelining of the source code you write, but it introduces another layer of
obfuscation that increases debugging overhead.

Could you try replacing type `int` with a superclass instance that had some of
type `int`'s attributes (e.g. `__add__`)? Unfortunately not; as type `int`
inherits directly from type `object`, there's no concrete superclass you can
really substitute:

```python
# '__mro__' stands for "Method Resolution
# Order". This resolves issues with multiple
# inheritance like "the diamond problem",
# where method resolution may be ambiguous:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem
#
# Guido van Rossum wrote more about method
# resolution order here:
# https://python-history.blogspot.com/2010/06/method-resolution-order.html
>>> int.__mro__
(<class 'int'>, <class 'object'>)
>>> type(None).__mro__
(<class 'NoneType'>, <class 'object'>)
>>>
```

I mention all these situations as a guy who fell into many of these holes (and
read about the rest). The implication behind software where engineers cannot
guarantee certain correctness properties along critical execution paths is that
recurring bugs can easily lead to alignment issues with the rest of the
organization, which at best increases management overhead and at worst impedes
the quality of execution.

---

Easy things should be simple, and we can clearly see that the easy path of
adding conditionals and special handling to problems can make things
complicated. Maybe there's another way. This is how I got into learning about
monads.

The key for me in understanding the benefit of monads was realizing _expressions
themselves don't cause exceptions, the evaluation of expressions causes
exceptions_. If you can resolve your expression to a type that can be evaluated
later, you may be able to handle exceptions as part of a type definition, which
could provide a handle for static analysis tools or compile-time guarantees to
hook into.

At this point, I want to introduce three different "things": `Maybe`, `Just`,
and `Nothing`. They're monads, and they can help us implement a safer version of
division without suffering many of the negative side effects that come with the
aforementioned alternatives.

(I won't go into a deeper dive of functors, applicatives, or monoids. Besides
the fact that I don't know them myself :see_no_evil:, I'd say a script-kitty
understanding that communicates intent/purpose is the "something different" that
can help people relate this solution with their existing problems and transcend
the stereotype that monads are hard to learn. If you would like to learn more
(and you -- and I -- absolutely should), a great resource is "Learn You a
Haskell for Great Good" by Miran Lipovača, whose book is [available for free
online](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters), or "Haskell Programming From
First Principles" by Christopher Allen and Julie Moronuku, whose book is
[available for purchase here](https://haskellbook.com/).)

Here's an initial definition of `Maybe`, `Just`, and `Nothing`:

```python
class _Maybe(object):
    """An implementation of the 'Maybe' monad.

    This class definition exists to add any monadic attributes or operators.

    Since we're talking about 'Maybe', 'Nothing', and 'Just' only, and since
    'Nothing' and 'Just' inherit from 'Maybe', we'll wrap any basic monadic
    attributes as part of this class definition.
    """


def Maybe(cls):
    """Parametrization of a typedef to include monadic attributes. This method
    enables dynamic classdef generation by inheriting a base class passed in as
    an input argument and overriding class attribute '__bases__'.

    This is a psuedo-definition of generics, which may assist understanding of
    monads between a statically typed language like Haskell and a dynamically
    typed language like Python.

    See the Python documentation for more information on method 'type()' and
    attribute '__bases__':

    https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#type
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#class.__bases__
    """
    # NOTE: Concrete implementation of Maybe() should be left to concrete base
    # types.
    raise NotImplementedError


class _Just(_Maybe):
    """A successful evaluation of a Maybe monad.
    """


def Just(cls):
    """Functional instantiation of `Just`.
    """
    return type('Just(%s)' % cls.__name__, (_Just, cls), {})


class _Nothing(_Maybe):
    """A failed evaluation of a Maybe monad.
    """


# Ensure that `Nothing` is unique; uniqueness implies same `id()` result, which
# implies a global object (singleton), much like `None = type(None)()` is a
# singleton.
#
# >>> id(type(None)())
# 4562745448 # Some object ID, this may vary.
# >>> id(None)
# 4562745448 # Same object ID as before.
# >>>
Nothing = _Nothing()
```

This results in the following:

```python
>>> Just(int)(1)
1
>>> type(Just(int)(1))
<class '__main__.Just(int)'>
```

What this bit of logic does is apply multiple inheritance to render effects onto
a parametrized base type. This is further made functional by using the
first-class function `type()` and the extended constructor method that updates
the underlying object attribute `__bases__`. This satisfies one property of the
Maybe monad, in that they can turn pure effects (e.g. a mathematical expression)
into impure effects (e.g. essentially replacing a try/catch statement with a
type).

(I first found out about the ability to parametrize types in a functional manner
in Python through the [**`odo`**](https://github.com/blaze/odo/) project, which
I became familiar with at work.)

---

So as a first-order approximation, our division operation which looked like
this:

```python
def div(a : int, b : int) -> float:
    return a / b
```

Can be turned into this:

```python
def safediv(a : Maybe(int), b : Maybe(int)) -> Maybe(float):
    if (
        a is Nothing or
        b is Nothing or
        b == 0
    ):
        return Nothing
    return Just(float)(a / b)
```

---

Okay, that's nice. So what's the clincher?

The second, game-changing aspect about monads is the sequencing / binding
operation. The type parametrization aspect of monads, at least applied in this
context, creates a bound on how a portion of control flow _should_ fail: it
simply returns `Nothing`. Because it's a _type_ that represents an _error_, and
because calling a monadic method with `Nothing` generates `Nothing` (enforcing
idempotency), the runtime doesn't need to worry about having to raise an
exception to avoid propagating an error that cannot be handled later on. As long
as the types match, it's safe to run. Errors become safe to pipeline, and
pipelining allows systems of arbitrary complexity to be developed.

This is powerful, because _it linearizes your error model_. No matter how
complex your pipeline may get, you should only ever expect to get more `Nothing`
types with a longer pipeline, and _not totally new types of errors_. You
shouldn't ever compose two monadic services and get a completely different
error. And if you do, you don't need to update the service itself, _you update
the monad type / object definition_, which enables all monadic services
leveraging that type to gain that benefit automatically after updating your
executable / runtime.

You may think this makes debugging harder because all failures are of type
`Nothing`. This isn't necessarily the case. Not only can you log the error
message / input arguments / metadata to reproduce the error as part of the monad
definition, you can also create new monad definitions whenever you need. Indeed,
[the Haskell documentation on monads for error
handling](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/category-extras-0.52.0/docs/Control-Monad-Either.html)
references `Either`, `Left`, and `Right` in place of `Maybe`, `Nothing`, and
`Just` respectively:

> The Either type is sometimes used to represent a value which is either correct
> or an error; by convention, the Left constructor is used to hold an error
> value and the Right constructor is used to hold a correct value (mnemonic:
> "right" also means "correct").

---

Let's try implementing binding / sequencing attributes for our monad classes.

```python
# Removing docstrings and comments for sake of brevity, entire script is
# referenced at the end of this post.
class _Maybe(object):
    def __init__(self, data=None):
        self.data = data
        raise NotImplementedError

    def bind(self, function):
        raise NotImplementedError

    def __rshift__(self, function):
        if not isinstance(function, _Maybe):
            error_message = 'Can only pipeline monads.'
            raise TypeError(error_message)

        if not callable(function):
            function = lambda _ : function

        return self.bind(function)

# ...

class _Just(_Maybe):
    def __init__(self, data=None):
        self.data = data

    def bind(self, function):
        return function(self)

# ...

class _Nothing(_Maybe):
    """A failed evaluation of a Maybe monad.
    """
    def __init__(self, _=None):

    def __str__(self):
        return "Nothing"

    def bind(self, _):
        return self
```

You can see that implementations of method `bind` are different based on the
monad class definition. `Nothing` always binds to `Nothing`, whereas `Just`
binds to itself applied within a function. Hence, state within the pipeline
mutates with `Just` and stays idempotent with `Nothing`.

Next, we can implement a form of
[currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) for our division method, so
that we can pipeline our monadic method calls the same as our monadic data:

```python
def curry(method):
    num_args = len(inspect.signature(method).parameters)

    def build_reader(argument_values, num_args):
        if num_args == 0:
            return method(*argument_values)
        else:
            return lambda x: build_reader(argument_values + [x], num_args - 1)

    # NOTE: This Reader class is important to understand when implementing the
    # full solution. For now, think of it as a helper class to implementing
    # curry using our existing monad class definitions. It's available in the
    # full script available at the end of this post.
    return Reader(build_reader([], num_args))
```

You can see that the helper method `build_reader` takes in a top-level,
decorated method `method` and builds a "Reader" object that expects some number
of arguments serially. You can think of this "Reader" class as the functional
analogue to [the object-oriented Builder
pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern).

Now, we can define some curried methods:

```python
@curry
def add(a : Maybe(int), b : Maybe(int)) -> Maybe(int):
    if (
        a is Nothing or
        b is Nothing
    ):
        return Nothing
    return Just(int)(a.data + b.data)

@curry
def div(denominator : Maybe(int), numerator : Maybe(int)) -> Maybe(float):
    if (
        numerator is Nothing or
        denominator is Nothing or
        denominator.data == 0
    ):
        return Nothing
    return Just(float)(numerator.data / denominator.data)
```

Finally, we can write some basic pipelines and see monads in action:

```python
>>> from monads import *
# Basic addition
>>> Just(int)(7) >> add(Just(int)(8))
15
# Basic division
>>> Just(int)(5) >> div(Just(int)(10))
0.5
# Division by zero, resulting in `Nothing`
>>> Just(int)(7) >> add(Just(int)(8)) >> div(Just(int)(0))
<monads._Nothing object at 0x1040b0b90>
# Add after division by zero, still returns `Nothing`
>>> Just(int)(7) >> add(Just(int)(8)) >> div(Just(int)(0)) >> add(Just(int)(15))
<monads._Nothing object at 0x1040b0b90>
```

---

If monads are so useful, then why don't we see them everywhere in production? As
we've seen, monads aren't so bad to reason about, and they do have some
significant benefits when used correctly. From my limited experience working
with monads, I can think of the following:

- **Object-oriented languages are not type-oriented**: Our return value for
  monadic division is a monadic type. _How do we use it when our language is
  object-oriented?_ Short answer is, you don't. Longer answer is, you don't
  because you would need to mutate all method definitions you wish to use as
  part of monadic pipelines to accept monadic types _only_, which may result
  in a Cambrian explosion of types across your project. Either all methods and
  types are monadic in a way the underlying language isn't built to handle, or
  a heterogeneous mix occurs where some methods accept some monadic types and
  some methods do not, which is impossible to maintain. This impediment is
  disqualifying for production software.

  Haskell is primarily a _type-oriented language_. You can create types in
  Haskell pretty much as easily as you can create objects in Python.
  Arbitrarily creating types in an object-oriented language like Python is
  akin to creating objects (state containers) in Haskell. You just don't do
  it.

  This goes back to a larger discussion about property assurances in
  languages, which I briefly touched on when I reviewed [variables that
  complect identity and
  state](/posts/2019/01/26/concurrency_with_python_identity_and_state) and how
  designing variables at that granularity is highly dependent on a cooperating
  language specification.

- **Powerful abstractions may prevent scalability**: Like it or not, most of
  the production software world works on paradigms predating that of the
  computer science world rediscovering monads. Having a powerful programming
  language can tightly couple your team of developers to the source code, and
  that's bad for business. This isn't cynicism; even healthy companies
  experience churn, and have to watch their bus factors, and have to hire
  junior developers as their labor funnel becomes longer and broader. Great
  production software is highly replaceable, and highly replaceable source
  code is defined at the interface contract layer, not by its error model.

  You may be surprised as I was to learn powerful abstractions don't
  necessarily result in performance penalties. Haskell does have an FFI, which
  is receiving a lot of attention in the Haskell 2020 specification RFC, and
  the [Glasgow Haskell Compiler](https://www.aosabook.org/en/ghc.html) has the
  ability to target C, LLVM IR, and native assembly.

This doesn't mean monads are completely useless, or learning about monads is
completely meaningless. The UNIX philosophy of building services that are great
at doing one thing, and composing pipelines out of those services, is very much
akin to monads in that they both enable composability. Having a discrete set of
error codes is akin to returning an erroneous type in that they both manage
failure in a predictable manner. The granularity may vary, and it's much more
implementation-dependent than property guarantees at the language level, but the
model is more or less the same. Monads represent a different way to think about
programming languages that remains highly applicable to modern production
software at a system design level.

---

Here's the full, final source code we worked through, [to run as one
file](/documents/2019/12/06/monads.py). All you need is a UNIX-like operating
system and a build of Python 3.7.x. After that, copy and paste the following
code block into your terminal:

```bash
curl -sSL https://bytes.yingw787.com/documents/2019/12/06/monads.py | tee $(mktemp) | $(which python3.7)
```
