## Overview

[Actors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) are containers of state
communicating with each other via [message
passing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing). Based on a received
message, actors can choose to:

- Send messages to other actors
- Create new actors
- Alter how it treats new messages it receives

And that's it! State exists, yet remains encapsulated, explicit, and observable,
among other benefits.

Actors are my favorite concurrency model, since they don't just make [simple
things easy](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy), but
[beautiful](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19707092) as well. Like
[separating identity from
state](/posts/2019/01/26/concurrency_with_python_identity_and_state), the
concurrency advantages of using actors stem from the property guarantees baked
into actor implementations, which form an unassuming yet unassailable moat in
terms of concurrency model adoption.

I also love actor models for a number of other reasons as well:

- **They're distributed-first**: Every actor communicates with the external
  world using messages. In this case, actors define "the external world" as
  _everything beyond itself_. With no global state to worry about, actors fit
  well in systems with arbitrarily variable [logical
  topologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_topology).

  This may be a valuable trait in the era of Internet-scale companies, as a
  reduced dependency on other hardware/software frameworks and models empowers
  you to better [commoditize your
  complements](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/06/12/strategy-letter-v/).

- **They're fault-tolerant**: Since actors have the ability to spawn new actors
  upon receiving a particular message, they have the ability to handle each
  other's exceptions and re-spawn crashed processes. This lends itself very well
  to inter-process supervision. [Erlang's OTP
  framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Telecom_Platform) formalizes
  this concept using [supervision
  trees](http://erlang.org/doc/design_principles/des_princ.html), and Erlang
  formalizes supervision in its ["let-it-crash" design
  philosophy](http://wiki.c2.com/?LetItCrash).

  Fault-tolerant languages and frameworks, combined with [system
  redundancy](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redundancy_(engineering)>), can
  result in absurdly high system uptimes. Joe Armstrong famously quoted that
  Erlang-based systems can have up to [99.9999999% uptime, although 99.999%
  uptime may be a more commonly expected
  figure](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8427032). By contrast, [AWS SLAs set a
  threshold of 99.99% availability for AWS services in a specific availability
  zone before service credits are
  distributed](https://aws.amazon.com/compute/sla/). Strong guarantees about
  fault tolerance greatly reduce operational expenditures in production,
  reducing financial and liability pressures on businesses and technical teams.

You may not want to use actor model concurrency if:

- **Your business logic is inherently sequential**: Lengthy and long-lived
  dependency chains may not support actors very well, because handling logic
  outside the individual actor (e.g. with multi-stage transactions) is not the
  actor model's strong suit.

- **You have an existing codebase that does not use actor models**:
  Interoperability between actor-model based frameworks and object-oriented
  frameworks may require an additional interface, like a message queue, if the
  system design and consequences like workload profile are to remain clear.
  Hence, actor-model based systems may be best implemented as a discrete
  service, and may otherwise induce a choice between object-oriented programming
  and actor-model programming.

- **You're focused on optimizing your system**: Rich Hickey mentions in the
  [Clojure spec about state](https://clojure.org/about/state) that since actors
  make so few assumptions about the world, the concurrency model is fairly
  inflexible to optimization. One example he gives is how actors cannot exploit
  being in the same process, e.g. by having multiple threads share the same
  immutable data structure. In this sense, actor models may be best used in
  arenas where any penalties due to lack of optimization can be amortized, such
  as in a data request generation layer, where you may piece together a request
  for data before flushing the request through
  [**`cffi`**](https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Actor Models in Python

There's a number of different ways you can apply actors in Python:

- [**`pykka`**](http://www.pykka.org/en/latest/): A partial port of
  [**`akka`**](https://akka.io/). Not recommended because actor
  supervision/linking and communicating with actors through network are not
  supported, messages are mutable, and a lack of continued development.

- [**`thespian`**](https://thespianpy.com/): A well-maintained, fully featured
  actor library, that runs on Linux. The downsides of this library may include a
  lack of actor-based tooling like [OTP
  libraries](http://erlang.org/doc/applications.html), a non-intuitive error
  model, and a lack of user adoption within the Python community.

- [**`erlport`**](http://erlport.org/docs/python.html): Erlang-based
  interoperablity library to call Python code using Erlang's [native implemented
  functions, or NIFs](http://erlang.org/doc/tutorial/nif.html). The actors are
  specified on the Erlang side, and hence remains outside the scope of this blog
  post.

- A bespoke implementation of threadless actors can be done [using
  monads](http://www.valuedlessons.com/2008/01/monads-in-python-with-nice-syntax.html).
  This is not recommended because many of the actor model primitives require
  implementation, and do not take advantage of Python's concurrent libraries.

This tutorial uses `thespian`.

### Message Passing

Credit to [the `thespian` documentation](https://thespianpy.com/doc/) for
inspiring many of these examples.

#### Receiving Messages

To create an actor, define an actor using `thespian.actors.Actor`:

```python
from thespian.actors import Actor

class Hello(Actor):
    def receiveMessage(self, message, sender):
        self.send(sender, "Hello, World!")
```

Then, create an instance of `thespian.actors.ActorSystem` and pipe a message to
your actor:

```python
from thespian.actors import ActorSystem

hello = ActorSystem().createActor(Hello)
print(ActorSystem().ask(hello, 'hi', 1))
```

You should see:

```python
Hello, World!
```

Printed to the console.

#### Linking Processes

Actors communicate with other actors via messages. For example, the "hello"
actor can be updated to create a "your_name" actor to print "Hello $YOUR_NAME":

```python
from thespian.actors import Actor

class Hello(Actor):
    def receiveMessage(self, message, sender):
        if message.startswith("Hello! My name is"):
            your_name = self.createActor(YourName)
            your_name_msg = (sender, "Hello, ", message)
            self.send(your_name, your_name_msg)

class YourName(Actor):
    def receiveMessage(self, message, sender):
        if isinstance(message, tuple):
            orig_sender, pre_hello, orig_message = message
            orig_name = orig_message.lstrip("Hello! My name is ")
            self.send(orig_sender, pre_hello + orig_name)
```

These two actors result in the following output in the IPython REPL:

```python
In [2]: from thespian.actors import ActorSystem

In [3]: ActorSystem()
Out[3]: <thespian.actors.ActorSystem at 0x7f74aae54160>

In [4]: hello = ActorSystem().createActor(Hello)

In [5]: ActorSystem().ask(hello, "Hello! My name is Ying")
Out[5]: 'Hello, Ying'
```

`thespian` also supports special system messages of type
`thespian.actors.ActorSystemMessage`. One of these may be
`thespian.actors.ActorExitRequest`. This can be used in order to make your actor
system idempotent under happy path conditions:

```python
from thespian.actors import Actor
from thespian.actors import ActorExitRequest

class Hello(Actor):
    def receiveMessage(self, message, sender):
        # Filter out `ChildExitedRequest` system messages.
        if (
            isinstance(message, str) and
            message.startswith("Hello! My name is")
        ):
            your_name = self.createActor(YourName)
            your_name_msg = (sender, "Hello, ", message)
            self.send(your_name, your_name_msg)
            # Terminate own process.
            self.send(self.myAddress, ActorExitRequest())

class YourName(Actor):
    def receiveMessage(self, message, sender):
        if isinstance(message, tuple):
            orig_sender, pre_hello, orig_message = message
            orig_name = orig_message.lstrip("Hello! My name is ")
            self.send(orig_sender, pre_hello + orig_name)
            # Terminate own process.
            self.send(self.myAddress, ActorExitRequest())

if __name__=='__main__':
    from thespian.actors import ActorSystem
    system = ActorSystem()
    hello = system.createActor(Hello)
    print(system.ask(hello, "Hello! My name is Ying"))
    # Shutdown ActorSystem instance.
    system.shutdown()
```

It's easy to see how properties like idempotency or atomicity, while not
intrinsic to actor-model based programming, can be easily implemented within an
actor-model based system, since there is only one interface, `receiveMessage()`,
communicating with the outside world.

#### Stateful Actors

Since actors are containers of state, they can change their response based on
both the messages received as well as their internal state. For example, an
actor-based counter may look something like this:

```python
from thespian.actors import Actor

class Counter(Actor):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.count = 0
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def receiveMessage(self, message, sender):
        if (
            isinstance(message, str) and
            message == "What's my count?"
        ):
            msg = "Your count is " + str(self.count)
            self.count += 1
            self.send(sender, msg)
```

Querying a freshly instantiated `Counter` actor instance may look something like
this:

```python
In [3]: from thespian.actors import ActorSystem

In [4]: counter = ActorSystem().createActor(Counter)

In [5]: ActorSystem().ask(counter, "What's my count?")
Out[5]: 'Your count is 0'

In [6]: ActorSystem().ask(counter, "What's my count?")
Out[6]: 'Your count is 1'

In [7]: ActorSystem().ask(counter, "What's my count?")
Out[7]: 'Your count is 2'
```

We send the same message but get a different response each time, because the
actor keeps track of its state. At the same time, the state is only made visible
to the external world through messages. State mutation takes place entirely
within the actor, which means any other messages querying actor state will
buffer until the mutation is complete, or fails and rolls back. _Incomplete and
invalid state is never exposed to the world outside the actor instance_.

Alan Kay mentioned this in a [mailing list
message](http://userpage.fu-berlin.de/~ram/pub/pub_jf47ht81Ht/doc_kay_oop_en) as
his definition of object-oriented programming:

> OOP to me means only messaging, local retention, and protection and hiding of
> state-process, and extreme late-binding of all things.

#### Effective Parallelization

`thespian`'s model of concurrency lies in the use of different
`thespian.actors.ActorSystem` implementations.

The naive `thespian.actors.ActorSystem` is not fully concurrent, as it utilizes
`thespian.system.simpleSystemBase`:

```python
In [6]: ActorSystem()._systemBase
Out[6]: <thespian.system.simpleSystemBase.ActorSystemBase at 0x10474bc88>
```

All actors registered with this system run on a single thread, with [reentrant
locks](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html#rlock-objects) blocking
access from other actors from sending or receiving messages. This can be seen in
`simpleSystemBase.ActorSystemBase.ask`, the method to send a message to an
actor:

```python
def ask(self, anActor, msg, timeout):
    self._realizeWakeups()
    sender = self.actorRegistry['System:ExternalRequester']
    with self._private_lock: # Instance of threading.RLock
        self._pendingSends.append(PendingSend(
            sender.address,
            msg,
            anActor
        ))
    return self.listen(timeout)
```

In order to use something a bit more parallel, and for deploying on general
Python environments, try using
`thespian.actors.ActorSystem('multiprocQueueBase')`:

```python
In [1]: from thespian.actors import ActorSystem

In [2]: ActorSystem('multiprocQueueBase')._systemBase
Out[2]: <thespian.system.multiprocQueueBase.ActorSystemBase at 0x109fcbfd0>
```

If you wish to use `multiprocTCPBase` or `multiprocUDPBase`, use Linux as the
[Python **`socket`** module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html)
method calls for `gethostname()` and `getaddrinfo()` is broken on macOS, as
detailed by [BPO-29705](https://docs.python.org/3/library/socket.html) and
[BPO-35164](https://bugs.python.org/issue35164).

An easy way to get started with a fully-fledged Python environment on Debian is
to use Docker and
[**`continuumio/anaconda3:latest`**](https://github.com/ContinuumIO/docker-images/blob/master/anaconda3/debian/Dockerfile)
as a virtualization layer. You can create this environment in Docker by running:

```bash
docker pull continuumio/anaconda3
docker run -i -d continuumio/anaconda3:latest
docker exec -it $CONTAINER_NAME bash
```

Also note that [Windows 10 Home does not come with a
hypervisor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/quick-start/enable-hyper-v),
which blocks installation of Docker. Consider blowing away Windows and using
Linux on bare metal.

Note that actor systems besides the base may create processes that persist
outside the orchestrating Python process. Use the base `ActorSystem()`
instantiation, as opposed to `ActorSystem('multiprocTCPBase')`, for best
results. In order to shutdown actor systems from an orchestrating process, wrap
`ActorSystem().shutdown()` in a [**`try/except/finally`**
clause](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#defining-clean-up-actions).

Aside from these concerns, the beauty of the actor model shines through. _It
doesn't care about the concurrency model_. You can swap out the concurrency
model by swapping out the underlying `ActorSystem()` implementation, and as long
as it implements `.ask()` properly, the actor will be able to communicate with
the system. If the actor cannot handle a message for some reason, it will simply
buffer in a mailbox for the actor to handle later. Hence, asynchronicity comes
out of the box with actors.

### Reactive Design Patterns

Like object-oriented programming, actor models also have their own design
patterns. Where object-oriented programming may have object-oriented design
patterns, such as those described in the ["Gang of Four" book on design
patterns](https://blog.yingw787.com/posts/2017/11/22/design_patterns/),
actor-model based programming has reactive design patterns, some of which are
described in ["Reactive Design Patterns", available
online](https://www.reactivedesignpatterns.com/categories.html).

Some of these include:

- **The Error/Kernel Pattern**: Within a supervision tree, keep actions with
  higher failure probabilities in the leaf/child nodes, and keep important
  application state and actions in parent nodes. One benefit of this practice is
  that leaf nodes can be much more cheaply restarted than parent nodes, which
  keeps more of the application running at all times.

- **The Let-It-Crash Pattern**: Significantly trim down the failure model by
  delegating failure handling to a supervisor process rather than handling it
  within a process. One way this pattern may help software engineers is in
  reducing technical debt by rendering some compatibility layers wholly
  unnecessary.

- **The Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Isolate failures from component to component
  by wrapping them in monitoring and handling logic to avoid calls likely to
  result in timeouts or high latencies. This prevents failures from propagating
  throughout an entire system, and localizes errors for easier troubleshooting.

## Conclusion

Actor models are a highly flexible and robust programming model if used and
implemented correctly. If your programming language supports state, you can
implement actor models and actor-based frameworks and libraries.

The biggest downside of actor models is in the need to think and practice at
scale even when there is no scale to worry about. Actor libraries and frameworks
built on on object-oriented programming languages appear contrived, deviant, and
unnecessary to programmers when the problems actors solve aren't readily
apparent.

This problem is made more difficult when actors are so powerful, people and
organizations [hide the fact they use it as a competitive
advantage](https://twitter.com/joeerl/status/1104298407231922176). Thankfully,
with the birth of newer actor-model based languages like
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), and seriously successful business cases of
actor models like
[WhatsApp](https://www.wired.com/2015/09/whatsapp-serves-900-million-users-50-engineers/),
actors are getting a lot more attention and consideration in enterprise use.
