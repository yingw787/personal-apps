**(Update 03/17/2019)**: As I am currently writing this, I am quite behind on my
seven-part series on concurrency models in Python, as begun in [this post back
in January](/posts/2019/01/11/concurrency_with_python_why). If I have mentioned
this to you in person as something I wanted to do and to check my blog for
updates, I apologize for the lack of progress on this front. It is still on my
roadmap. Ideally, I'll finish it up before [PyCon
2019](https://us.pycon.org/2019/), and posts will be updated out of order
(posted after this for their original due dates in January and February). Newer
posts will be created after this one.

I had discovered [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
shortly before joining my current company, and I was impressed by its arguments
for why you should keep and maintain a good changelog. That need became ever
more visible in my current role, where until very recently, there wasn't a
dedicated product manager for our small team. If I didn't maintain a changelog,
I'd make it more difficult for myself to inform internal customers, prospective
additions to the team, or stakeholders about the work done on this project, and
I'd lose a lot of the hard-earned knowledge to the void forever, with all the
consequent and compounding problems that result from lossy communications. So I
decided to maintain a changelog and see how it would help my development
workflow, and if I could glean any insights from it after maintaining it for a
while.

### Lessons Learned

- **Migrations of unstructured data are nigh impossible**: You may notice that
  the current "Keep a Changelog" points have _Deprecated_, _Fixed_,
  _Security_, _Unreleased_, and _[YANKED]_ bullets. I think an older version
  of the site had only the "[ADDED] [CHANGED] [REMOVED]" bullets that I use
  here. I think the new bullets are an improvement, as a higher granularity of
  metrics may mean better-formed KPIs. I continued to use the old schema
  because using different schemas in the same changelog may be confusing to
  newcomers, because I don't expect my tool to deal with security issues
  within enterprise environments, and because a manual re-write of a changelog
  is at the very bottom of a literal mountain of feature requests, bugs, and
  other issues I have on my plate.

- **Granularity varied but trended higher over time**: When I first started
  off, I oftentimes just listed what happened, and didn't add much detail
  (e.g. `[ADDED] Dependency 'py4j'.`). Later on, I described _why_ I was doing
  something (e.g. `[ADDED] Dependency 'pyjks' to convert OpenSSL-generated
public keys into Java truststores.`). I think this definitely helps in
  jogging my memory and detail why any particular action is important, and
  helps to automatically build the shared understanding when communicating the
  vision of a product.

- **There's not enough information about what changes apply to a particular
  release**: This is rectified in the newer release of our product, but for
  this release, I only keep the major/minor version numbers, and not the build
  versions or the patch versions. This means at a glance of the changelog, you
  can't tell which features are available for a particular release. In
  practice, I use [GitLens](https://gitlens.amod.io/) and `git blame` to
  identify what changes are applicable between which releases, and more
  frequently the pull requests for a recent feature (which I make sure to
  always have the full changelog updates before merging). Oftentimes, since
  I've been working on this by myself for more than a year, I can do a simple
  mental recall if somebody has a question. This obviously isn't scalable;
  hence the new changes to be implemented.

- **I do wish there were more [REMOVED] updates**: At this point, I have made
  174 [ADDED], 141 [CHANGED], and only **14 [REMOVED]** updates to the
  project. I have found when I needed to remove some features, I do it in one
  fell swoop, and it's because I had slowly added functionality to make all
  that code irrelevant. Still, there's a lot of legacy code left in the
  product, and porting over functionality to new paradigms I've recently
  learned or implemented is slow going. I think we have a good balance between
  developer velocity and supporting customers, but without additional
  developers to give a real second opinion, that hypothesis remains untested.
  Deprecations are also unheard of in this product, and would be a highly
  welcome addition to my development workflows.

All in all, I've found maintaining a changelog to be highly worth it. It's
pretty much the only document that I constantly update and remember to update
(design documents, flight rules, etc. become outdated at a brisk pace), I love
the portability and independence it gives from deployment platforms (no GitHub
releases and form-filling on web apps), and it's great for giving a birds-eye
view of what I have done.

**(Correction on 2019/05/11)**: The above mentioned changelog was originally
made available as part of this blog post. Due to a misunderstanding, it has been
taken down.
