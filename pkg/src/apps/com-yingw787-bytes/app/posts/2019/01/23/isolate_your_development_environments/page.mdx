Today I wanted to share with you the hardest bug that I have encountered yet at
work. It's a great argument for why language-specific "virtual environments"
don't really work well in practice, especially if there's a mismatch between its
intended use cases and yours, and why you should strictly isolate your
development environment from your build environment even while compiling
locally.

I use [**`conda`**](https://anaconda.org/) for my development environment.
`conda` is very helpful in terms of isolating and deploying your source code
**only** into production, but as it turns out, it can fail pretty hard in terms
of making sure the rest of your development environment remains free of any side
effects it generates.

Sometimes, I need to compile on-premise distributions of my ETL tool in order to
verify its functional integrity from my development laptop. This custom-built
compilation process, while it manages itself quite well, doesn't really check
for side effects because it assumes it is compiling in our CI/CD pipelines.

You might see where this is going.

So there's this dependency called [**`freetds`**](http://www.freetds.org/),
which enables your Unix-based operating system to talk to Windows-based database
products like Microsoft SQL Server. This is important if you want your ETL tool
to talk to SQL Server and ingest data from it. This dependency in turn requires
a dependency on [**`openssl`**](https://www.openssl.org/), which is an
open-source implementation of the TLS/SSL encryption protocol. We keep the copy
of `openssl` we compile with in a special location, and the compilation process
fetches that copy of `openssl`.

One day, I was executing a compilation to check a particular feature. Instead of
the rather straightforward build I was expecting, I got this logged out instead:

```

To be honest, this was a little terrifying. Not only did I not see _anything_
like this before, I not know how C/C++ projects are compiled, and I also didn't
understand how my own tool's compilation process worked underneath the hood
because it was handled by another team.

Although I asked around, the bug got propagated, and multiple people took a
look, none of us really knew what was going on. The distribution was compiling
fine on the CI/CD pipelines, and because we were finalizing our major release
and didn't have enough man-hours to devote to this, we decided to work on source
code only changes, pay extra super-duper attention during code review, and just
verify it worked in development before merging into release. Obviously, this
dont-poke-the-kraken approach was unsustainable over the long run given how
different the development and distribution environments were (How different?
Different enough to bite us), and one day we simply needed to squash this bug.
Our senior devops engineer and I began pair programming on my machine to
diagnose this issue.

So first, we tried logging out all the environment variables that touched the
compilation. One is the default `$PATH` variable. My mistake was letting `conda`
prepend its own path to `$PATH`. If `conda` isn't at the head of `$PATH`,
running `$(which python)` may turn up a different Python version in your
environment than `conda`, which is not what `conda` wants.

Did you know that `conda` comes with its own version of OpenSSL (besides the
version that is compiled with Python)? I didn't either!

So this was an issue of the compile process finding the wrong version of OpenSSL
to use. I simply renamed the executable in `/path/to/anaconda2/bin` from `ssl`
to `ssl.bak`, and then made sure that `$PATH` did not have the path to `conda`
prepended, but rather appended instead, as I still needed access to my
development environment. Somehow though, the OpenSSL binaries from `conda` were
still being pulled into the build process, _even though the path to the correct
version of OpenSSL was ahead in `$PATH` and should have been picked up first_.

All this didn't address one particular nagging concern; exactly why was
_OpenSSL_ complaining of not understanding some _internal variables_? Even if
the slightly different version of OpenSSL was used, it should all still compile
correctly, right? For a while, I wondered whether OpenSSL published a broken
build that I downloaded and tried to compile, because `pyspark` had came broken
with some of the newer release builds of Apache Spark. This turned out to not be
the case. Then I wondered whether `freetds` relied on a specific version of
OpenSSL, which after combing through the source code, turned out not to be the
same either. So this meant the `freetds` compilation errors were blocked by
OpenSSL build failures while the OpenSSL libraries worked fine previously
(proved out by regressions successfully transporting data over HTTPS), and while
`freetds` did not rely on a specific OpenSSL version.

We needed additional information on how to turn on verbose output during
compilation of `freetds` to see what inputs it was taking in. There wasn't a
whole lot of information in the README for `freetds` on how to do this, and not
much information online. Eventually we found a variable called `AM_V_CC`, which
is [used in `make` debugging](https://autotools.io/automake/silent.html).
Recursively `grep`-ing for this variable turned up the statement `AM_V_CC =
$(am__v_CC_$(V))` was found. Recursively `grep`-ing `am__v_CC_*` found the
statement `am__v_CC_ = $(am__v_CC_$(AM_DEFAULT_VERBOSITY))` in
[**`fisql`**](https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/1-fisql/)'s Makefile,
which then led us to recursively `grep` for `AM_DEFAULT_VERBOSITY`.

A lot of work to tell us verbosity was passed in with the flag `--V={0,1}`, 1
for verbose output. But now, we had the keys to the kingdom.

Now, when we ran `make clean && make V=1 2>&1 | tee debug.out`, we could see
something suspicious:

```
In file included from /path/to/anaconda2/include/openssl/e_os2.h:13:0,
from /path/to/anaconda2/include/openssl/ssl.h:15,
from ../../include/freetds/tls.h:37,
from tls.c:55:
```

Somehow, miraculously, `/path/to/anaconda2/include` was showing up! This means
some files related to OpenSSL are fetched from the `conda` version instead of
the proper location, _and_ being used by `freetds` during compilation! So why is
this happening?

After executing the build process with an inline `$PATH` excluding the directory
entirely, `tee`-ing the verbose output to a file, and `vimdiff`-ing it with a
log of the original run, the file `/path/to/anaconda2/bin/odbc_config` was
discovered. This executable had a `--include-prefix` flag, which when run added
`/path/to/anaconda2/include` to the `make` command.

Did you know that `conda` came with an `odbc_config` executable? I didn't
either! I still don't even know what it does. I renamed it to `odbc_config.bak`,
reran compilation, and everything worked again.

So in conclusion, an unknown executable caused the `freetds` Makefile
configuration setup to include the `conda` header files, causing the header
files for OpenSSL to be fetched from a separate directory than the source files
for a separate version of OpenSSL. The headers and source were not compatible
with each other, which caused OpenSSL to fail compilation.

In doing all of this, I broke my development environment. I had failed to script
the development environment install because small [bus
factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) meant prioritization of
features over taking time to setup reproducible development environments. This
wasn't a large loss by any means, as I had kept instructions and [flight
rules](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules) elsewhere; this was just
somewhat inconvenient. An hour of bash scripting, and it's patched, good as new.

So what did I learn from this whole experience?

- **`conda` is a virtual environment for Python, and not a full-service virtual
  environment**. If you are deploying source code, training models, or otherwise
  using Python at a high level, `conda` is a good fit. Otherwise, consider a
  tool like [**`vagrant`**](https://www.vagrantup.com/) or
  [**`docker`**](https://www.docker.com/). Vagrant in particular is intended for
  development environments, with source files compiled on a virtual machine
  connected to a regular developer front-end. I've heard of development issues
  with containerization (exactly what I don't remember), so if I had to do it
  over again, I would rely on Vagrant.

- When in doubt, **turn on verbose logs during compilation** and `diff` those
  logs against those you know work. We would not have been able to debug this
  issue had the logs not mentioned the incorrect include paths.

- **Source code is the true documentation**, especially for more obscure and
  less well maintained open source projects. You can't be afraid of diving into
  the source because sometimes that's the only way you can figure out what's
  going on.

When we have the time, we will probably create separate CI/CD pipelines for
client-side tooling in order to not risk encountering issues like these.

Much thanks to Jeremy Hutchins (senior devops engineer) for the assistance;
solving this problem would not be possible without him.
