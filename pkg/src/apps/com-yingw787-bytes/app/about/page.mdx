Hi, I'm Ying. I'm a software engineer and product owner who loves to talk shop
and ship product. This is my professional online platform where I document the
memorable experiences in my career, that may deliver value to you as well.

I commonly publish my posts on [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs) and [Hacker
News](https://news.ycombinator.com). Feel free to repost or share any and all
posts here at your liberty, or engage in the discussion threads backlinked on
these posts if they're active and engaging. I care more about getting more
people to see my content, than reaping karma.

I don't have comments enabled on my blog. I used to, but [Disqus sent ads my
way](/posts/2020/01/26/get_rid_of_disqus) and I haven't found a replacement I
liked. In any case, I think dynamic, server-loaded content might not be the best
fit for a static website.

Feel free to reach out to me at `me@yingw787.com`. I'm always looking to improve
my work, and I'd love to hear what you think. Also cool to talk about anything
else too.
