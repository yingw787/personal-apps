I purchased this book on clearance in a Barnes and Noble in Clarendon (a
neighborhood in Arlington County). I didn't think I would get it any cheaper on
Amazon (it was $9), and it seemed like a good read. I watched the movie
adaptation and it was a bit Hollywood-ish and personality-driven. After reading
the book, it's safe to say the book is a lot better.

The book is divided up into two parts, and I was surprised at how short Part I
(the Sixth Army attacking Stalingrad) was. Most of the book is in Part II,
devoted to Operation Uranus where seven Soviet armies destroyed the weak Nazi
flanks and surrounded and starved Sixth Army to death.

It kind of makes sense. Stalingrad was absolutely leveled in the first two days,
when 40,000 civilians died. However, this produced the ideal conditions for
defenders, because everything was unrecognizable and anybody coming in had to
tread carefully. Hence, the majority of the casualties came after the city was
destroyed. The Nazi commanders are portrayed as first confident of victory, and
then wondering how exactly they lost 30% of their troops (dead, not wounded) a
few hours after they arrived from Kharkov or another Nazi supply point. This
then turned to panic as they were surrounded, which eventually turned into the
five stages of grief as the Sixth Army was starved into surrender. If either
side had valued the sanctity of human life in their military planning,
Stalingrad would have been the graveyards of far fewer men.

The author does a great job with displaying the "he said, she said" depictions
of the battle. As the book was published in the 1970s, when plenty of Nazi and
Soviet generals from the battle were still alive, there was much investment into
touting one's own side or blaming others. However, there are plenty of footnotes
describing how trustworthy every witness is, and the author traveled all over
Europe in order to get as many different perspectives as possible. It shows in
the richness of the imagery from the witness testimonies. In doing so, he
portrays the difficult work of teasing the byzantine, lossy nature of
historiography into history and the truth.

I was mildly surprised to notice just how much Hitler's character traits
betrayed the fact he didn't deserve the chancellorship of Germany (and like many
dictators failed upwards):

- **High arrogance**: Hermann Goering promised Hitler that the Luftwaffe can
  fly in 200+ tons of supplies into the _Kessel_ (Stalingrad pocket) every day
  to keep the Sixth Army supplied until relief forces broke through. Hitler
  believed Goering's boasts without question. Previously, Sixth Army had 750+
  tons of supplies provided via railroad for an optimal operational tempo.
  After Soviet anti-aircraft batteries had been entrenched and the Red Air
  Force seized air superiority, the Luftwaffe suffered more than four hundred
  transport planes shot down. In the end, only about 80 tons of supplies came
  into Pitomnik airfield every day to feed, fuel, and arm 250,000 troops. When
  the last Junkers supply plane landed at Pitomnik Airfield (Sixth Army
  airbase in the _Kessel_), the Nazi airport handlers didn't even have the
  physical strength to lift the supplies off the plane, and the plane left
  Pitomnik with a full load.

- **Goal shifting**: Hitler originally ordered Sixth Army to remain in
  Stalingrad, denying Paulus "freedom of action", because of Goering's promise
  as stated above. Afterwards, Sixth Army was ordered to remain put in order
  to tie down seven Soviet armies that would otherwise lead the drive to cut
  off other Nazi armies in the Caucasus. Then, after Sixth Army officers
  protested that Sixth Army could no longer provide any useful resistance in
  case Soviet armies peeled off guarding the Stalingrad pocket anyways, Sixth
  Army was ordered to die for ideological reasons (in order words, Goebbels'
  propaganda and benefit).

- **Supreme pettiness and intellectual laziness**: Hitler and General Albert
  Jodl got into a screaming match September 7th, 1942 about the overextension of
  Nazi supply lines, poor communications, and exposed flanks. Hitler then
  proceeded to eat the rest of his meals without including his generals,
  eventually leading to an irreparable divide between the Nazi
  commander-in-chief and OKW (the Wehrmacht high command) regarding military
  strategy.

- **Indecision and cowardice**: In the beginning of the battle, Hitler ordered
  Fourth Army towards the Baku oil fields, leaving Sixth Army to attack
  Stalingrad alone. Then he ordered Fourth Army to join the fight after a few
  hours, leaving both armies uncoordinated and crossing each other. Paulus
  also had to wait for Hitler's orders to close the pincer movement destroying
  the Soviet 62th Army, which allowed tens of thousands of Soviet troops to
  withdraw into the city and conduct urban warfare, nullifying much of the
  Nazi's tactical advantage in blitzkrieg and field warfare. This is similar
  to the Nazi strategic failings at Dunkirk and D-Day on the Western Front.

  At the end of the siege, Sixth Army aide Captain Winrich Behr pointedly asked
  Hitler whether "it may count on...support within the next fourty-eight hours".
  Hitler smiled and said he would talk it over with his advisers. That support
  never came.

- **Disdain towards the weak**: When Hitler's train crossed a troop train full
  of wounded Nazis, the Nazis all gathered next to the window to see their
  Fuhrer. When Hitler noticed, he "angrily ordered the curtains shut, leaving
  the wounded to be reminded of their predicament".

I definitely got the impression Fredrich Paulus is a "good person" (the kind I
described in my [blog post making the case against good
people](/posts/2019/03/14/the_case_against_good_people)) -- a lemming who
follows orders without question even when they make no sense. Paulus eventually
converted to Communism and preached anti-Fascist propaganda from Moscow after
his capture, and spent his last days living in East Germany railing against all
his detractors, cut off from all the friends and family he betrayed.

The top quote reminded me of something Donald Trump would say. I was saddened by
that; history really does rhyme. Don't get me wrong. Donald Trump is also not
Adolf Hitler (much less competent and less megalomaniacal). I just hope the
power brokers in the U.S. who think they can handle/control a POTUS remember how
the [Junkers](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junker_(Prussia)>) thought the same
thing about Hitler, and annihilated themselves and their country. I really don't
want to go down that path.
