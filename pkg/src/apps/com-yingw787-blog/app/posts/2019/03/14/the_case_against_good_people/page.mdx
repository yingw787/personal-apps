I've been following the [trials of Paul
Manafont](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trials_of_Paul_Manafort) that have been
taking place down the road from where I live, and with both federal trials
having come to a conclusion, I can safely say I am rather concerned.

Not because Paul Manafort was [the campaign manager of our dearly beloved 45th
POTUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Manafort#Chairman_of_Donald_Trump's_2016_campaign),
or because in his previous work as [advisor for the Russian puppet Viktor
Yanukovych](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Manafort#Lobbying_for_Viktor_Yanukovych_and_involvements_in_Ukraine),
he may have advised the violent putdown of Euromaidan protests resulting in
[about 130 identified
deaths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_people_killed_during_Euromaidan),
or because he made a [plea deal with the Special
Counsel](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/491-paul-manafort-plea-agreement-breach/49c0d15e0a829872d8c9/optimized/full.pdf#page=1)
and then [subsequently broke
it](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/5737401/2-13-19-Manafort-Order.pdf),
or because after all that he was [sentenced to 47 months in prison in his first
trial, less than the 19-24 years requested by the
prosecution](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/us/politics/paul-manafort-sentencing.html).

No. I'm not concerned because of all that. I'm concerned because in spite of all
that, Judge Amy Berman Jackson [sentenced Mr. Manafort to 3.5 years in prison
out of a possible
10](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/us/politics/paul-manafort-sentencing.html).

Why did she grant such a lenient sentence? As it turns out, due of "guidelines
intended to limit punishment in overlapping cases", her sentencing is limited by
the prior judge's ruling. The prior judge, who in my humble opinion is [rather
biased](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/08/01/manafort-trial-judge-ellis-757141).
So biased, in fact, he reminded me of [another rather biased
judge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Freisler). Maybe she was worried
that her sentence may be overturned on appeal. However, given the specter of
state charges, the clear 40-year long progression of the politicization of the
judicial system, and the fact that the prior judge had issued a sentence _lower
than that requested by the defense counsel_, she might have risked a re-trial or
a Presidential pardon and followed the maximum sentencing guidelines with little
worry that any legal precedents were broken on her end. Instead, she chose to
follow the rules to the letter.

So today, I wanted to make a case against "good people". As you might be able to
tell from all the Nazi and Holocaust references, this isn't exactly a happy
post, and it's not one I'm happy writing. In fact I think I tried to [make the
exact opposite argument a while
earlier](/posts/2018/11/25/the_terrifying_power_of_love); in that, I don't know
if I was able to convince even myself. But I do think the time has come for good
people to understand why sometimes, soley "being good" isn't the answer to a
long-standing problem. And although the likelihood for advice being followed is
bleak, I do think there's a way for "good people" to come out on top, after all
of this.

So what makes a "good person"? Here's three characteristics:

- **They're fundamentally disinterested in power**: This is all forms of
  power. Both [soft power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power), and the
  "if you can shoot the rich guy at any time and take his money, you're as
  rich as him" kind of power.

- **They trust in the system**: Following from the first point, they readily
  accept the limitations of the society they exist in, and hence do not pay
  enough attention to what _is_ (publicly declared information), what _might
  be_ (undeclared information or information that may not exist), and what
  _isn't_ (information that has changed since they last checked and isn't true
  anymore).

- **They're very rules-based**: If something exceeds their boundaries, you can
  count on them to step back. They not only find some things far enough
  outside their code of ethics to be reprehensible, they sometimes have a hard
  time imagining somebody optimizing for such an outcome, and hence believe it
  cannot happen.

These are the kinds of people your mother and father likely would have taught
you to become. The kind of people who come out on top in a Disney movie, the
secondary or tertiary protagonists living in a hut somewhere baking pies and
washing dishes. The kind who just want to raise good children and good
grandchildren, who are accepting of their limitations, and who fear God.

In our world, all too often, they're the people who lose.

---

So why would I say they lose? Why is it so dangerous to be a "good person"?

To do this, I thought this would be a good time to share a parable, of an
American investment banker and a Mexican fisherman. The version I copied this
from, and the credit goes to, [Financial
Mentor](https://financialmentor.com/true-wealth/the-parable-of-the-mexican-fisherman-and-investment-banker/2422):

> An American investment banker was taking a much-needed vacation in a small
> coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked. The
> boat had several large, fresh fish in it.
>
> The investment banker was impressed by the quality of the fish and asked the
> Mexican how long it took to catch them.
>
> The Mexican replied, “Only a little while.”
>
> The banker then asked why he didn’t stay out longer and catch more fish?
>
> The Mexican fisherman replied he had enough to support his family’s immediate
> needs.
>
> The American then asked “But what do you do with the rest of your time?”
>
> The Mexican fisherman replied, “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my
> children, take siesta with my wife, stroll into the village each evening where
> I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos: I have a full and busy life,
> señor.”
>
> The investment banker scoffed, “I am an Ivy League MBA, and I could help you.
> You could spend more time fishing and with the proceeds buy a bigger boat, and
> with the proceeds from the bigger boat you could buy several boats until
> eventually you would have a whole fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling
> your catch to the middleman you could sell directly to the processor,
> eventually opening your own cannery. You could control the product, processing
> and distribution.”
>
> Then he added, “Of course, you would need to leave this small coastal fishing
> village and move to Mexico City where you would run your growing enterprise.”
>
> The Mexican fisherman asked, “But señor, how long will this all take?”
>
> To which the American replied, “15-20 years.”
>
> “But what then?” asked the Mexican.
>
> The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part. When the time is right
> you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become
> very rich. You could make millions.”
>
> “Millions, señor? Then what?”
>
> To which the investment banker replied, “Then you would retire. You could move
> to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little,
> play with your kids, take siesta with your wife, stroll to the village in the
> evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.”

This parable commonly communicates the importance of building alignment between
your actions and your end goals (why go to all the effort to do the same thing
you are doing right now?), and render visible the opportunity cost of any action
you take (e.g. you'd lose 15-20 years of your life -- the best years, no less --
to this effort). But I think the American investment banker had some good points
that weren't mentioned by this parable. Take the following situations; what would
you do if:

- [**The President of Mexico launches an attack against a drug cartel in his
  home province to curry favor with his voter base, splintering and dispersing
  the cartels and beginning the Mexican Drug
  War**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Drug_War#Presidency_of_Vicente_Fox):
  While you remain vulnerable if you are rich or powerful as you present a
  more visible target, our Mexican fisherman -- who is fundamentally
  interested in power -- is _completely at the mercy of both sides_, the drug
  cartels looking for protection money, and the corrupted, underpaid police
  officers who want bribes. The wealthy and powerful can pay off ransoms until
  they secure exit visas for their families, effectively parrying off attacks
  by ablating their wealth instead of their health or physical safety.

- [**Your child is diagnosed with leukemia, requiring treatment in Mexico
  City**](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/leukemia-in-children.html): From some
  cursory searches, it looks like Mexico provides universal healthcare to its
  citizens at both a federal and state level. However, if you have a larger
  family and no other source of income besides fishing, you may need to
  continue supporting your family over seeing your child. If you had an
  independent source of income, you could afford to take months or years off
  to support your child. And of course, depending on whether budget cuts are
  on the horizon, and who the government hires for public policy
  consultations, the very notion of having free or subsidized healthcare
  available for granted may come into question. This demonstrates a heavy
  _reliance on the system_.

- [**A corrupt judge sentences you, an innocent person, to a harsh sentence
  for profit**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kids_for_cash_scandal): Would
  you respect a ruling if it seemed harsh? If you don't respect it in a
  respectful way, such as appeal, you may be bled dry financially and
  emotionally, while still remaining at somebody else's mercy (or lack
  thereof). To not respect it in a disrespectful way is to break the rules --
  and obviously, _you can't have that_.

Of course, parables are made to be broken, and there remain counterpoints to
these points. However, they would still require knowledge of "how to play the
game", which fits into my point. Sometimes, _it's not enough to be good, or
right_. There's enough problems in the world that don't respect goodness or
rightness, and those problems can only be addressed by the logic of power.
Possessing power gives you choices.

And to those who may scoff that these are edge cases, I would say these are
simply the edge cases that we know about. If you have no power, you remain
vulnerable in an infinite number of ways, with a number of those plausible and
executable.

Hence, some of the bitter lessons that too few people learn in time come into
view:

- **There are no absolutes**: When it comes to any science, particlarly the
  social sciences, hypotheses are never perfectly true. In fact, it only takes
  one case disproving it to collapse the whole model. And even if they are
  partially true, that truth may change over time. If you have healthcare, you
  might not be covered for a given condition due to a clause you passed over.
  And if you have healthcare passed in law, that doesn't mean the government
  will execute well in providing it, maliciously or otherwise. _You can't
  build certainties on uncertainties_. Oftentimes, "good people" do just this.

- **What is given, can be taken away**: If your safety, health, or wealth
  exists at the mercy of somebody else, and they decide that the status quo no
  longer benefits them, you're not safe, healthy, or wealthy anymore. "Good
  people" will assume that because they had the power to demand and receive
  such services before, they will continue to receive such services _ad
  infinitum_ without further demanding it.

In short, "good people" build very low congruency between "their problems" and
"their fault". It results in mindsets of helplessness, resentment, and
suffering. Life in such a world is no fun. It's toxic, embarrassing, and
unproductive.

So, as long as the wolves live amongst us, what are some things you can do?

- **Consistently pay for high-quality information**: You can only really trust
  what you pay, and information is the most easily corruptible resource, since
  your judgments may vary widely on how much of the full truth it contains. If
  you pay your sources, they're incentivized to not lose out on your
  business/income in the future, and (ideally) provide competitive services,
  meaning at least against smaller-sized players, any dearth of information
  will impact everybody and not just you. What you do not know about, you
  cannot protect against.

- **Accept liberally and emit conservatively**: Be able to accept a wide
  breadth of opinions and actions without resorting to breaking the rules. Do
  not give people a reason to single you out and target you, unless you desire
  to die on a particular hill (which may be important).

- **Practice proportional response to threats**: Power cannot exist where it
  is not practiced or demonstrated, and will disappear if it is not exercised;
  this is the same principle of "if you can and you don't, can you really
  _can_?". Yet power also disappears if it is used too often or too harshly;
  since most sources of power are derived, they require replenishment from
  other centers of power, which is often slow and not guaranteed. In this
  situation, harbor your resources, pay attention to and evaluate threats on a
  continual basis, and be wary of dying on any particular hill. Proportional
  response is one of the strategems used to execute this plan; prevent threat
  escalation and multiplication, divert and dissuade potential threats away
  from attacking you, and grant you time to formulate your next play vs.
  acting on a series of knee-jerk reactions that may cost you greatly.

I know off the bat that most people won't see this post, or hear any of this
kind of advice from anybody. And you know what? _That's ok_. In fact, maybe
better than okay; a world where everybody lives in their own castle is not too
much fun either, and accepting this bleak reality as the only possible due to
the limits of each person are fallacial, as a better world from all our efforts
is indeed possible. In addition, sometimes you can't defend against a larger,
persistent opponent with significant resource asymmetries. You have to resort to
other solutions sometimes.

For example, dying on a hill of trying to make the world a kinder, more
empathetic place (e.g. donating a large fortune to [whack
malaria](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2005/10/Gates-Foundation-Commits-2583-Million-for-Malaria-Research),
or volunteering for [Médecins Sans Frontières](https://www.msf.org/) with the
risk of [being
attacked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunduz_hospital_airstrike)), is
something I think is highly admirable. Creating these kinds of social surpluses,
especially faster than what a handful of bad actors can take, is what makes our
lives worth living as we find purpose in each other, and encourages the belief
we will bequeath a better world for our children.

Some things are more important than power, or the truth. Things like hope.
Trying to find that balance in our world of organized chaos is hard enough when
you're trying. So don't be a "good person" and go into this blind. Understand,
appraise, and execute with knowledge. Through this, you may find your peace no
matter what the world may throw at you.
