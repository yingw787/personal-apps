I first heard of Gavin de Becker when Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon and owner of
the Washington Post, referenced de Becker in the above blog post regarding [The
National Enquirer's attempted extortion of
Bezos](https://apnews.com/b8122770a15d43b88dfdcd9655912134). Apparently, this
decision was spurred by de Becker's recommendation that American Media Inc., the
National Enquirer's parent company, would not expect this play, and given the
hilarity of [AMI investigating
itself](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/ami-investigate-bezos-extortion-allegation-says-it-acted-lawfully-n969276)
and (I'm guessing) eating its own young in the process without destroying enough
evidence to prevent de Becker from tracing the source to suffer the wrath of one
of the richest men in the world, it seems to have worked. As an additional
bonus, David Pecker (AMI's CEO) may have violated a prior plea deal to not
commit crimes and may be [exposed to federal
charges](https://pagesix.com/2019/02/08/blackmail-scandal-could-leave-enquirer-boss-pecker-facing-federal-charges/).
A result so beautiful it brings tears to my eyes.

I had also heard that Mr. de Becker had published a book, and decided to check
it out when I went to [Politics and Prose](https://www.politics-prose.com/) to
listen to [Cal Newport's talk on digital
minimalism](https://www.politics-prose.com/event/book/cal-newport-digital-minimalism-choosing-focused-life-in-noisy-world).
As it turned out, they did carry a copy, and I purchased it in support of my
local bookstore (sorry Mr. Bezos).

Mr. de Becker proceeds through the book to break down a number of psychological
profiles of people hurting other people. In the process, he goes over how their
victims behaved in each situation. In doing so, he details fear at its most
effective:

- **Fear is a gut feeling**: By all means, don't ignore your intuition because
  of perceived social pressures. If your gut tells you to do something, you
  should do it. Better to be non-conformist and alive than comformist and
  dead. If somebody is being too nice, be forceful and say no.

- **Fear energizes; it does not paralyze**: If you ever find yourself in a
  high-stakes situation, your System 1 (spinal cord) will likely tell you what
  to do. It's like an out-of-body experience. I felt it the first time I was
  robbed. You are kind of just along for the ride. Somehow that evening I
  slept like a baby, because nobody will break into a house that has busted
  locks and no valuables.

- **Fear should be rare**: You shouldn't live in a constant state of anxiety
  or worry, because it dampens the signal of fear when you need it the most
  and cost you everything. If you are feeling anxious or fearful, it is likely
  because of some persistent factor in your life (you don't like your job, you
  don't like living in a particular place, a problem with friends, etc.). Get
  out of that situation so that your fear can shine you when you need it.

This is a pretty bad explanation of how this book went, but I thought it was
worth the buy for the information I got out. You should get the book yourself in
order to learn more.
