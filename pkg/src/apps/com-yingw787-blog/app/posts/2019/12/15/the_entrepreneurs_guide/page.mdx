I think Sherry does a great job in speaking to entrepreneurs about mental health
in general, and mental health in the context of consistent, persistent stressors
(like starting and running a company). For me at least, it sometimes feels like
a constant battle to keep my head above water, and I'm not even running a
company. But I do think there's freedom in choosing our problems. In the end,
that's what freedom is for, to discover which problems you'd rather face, and
the ones you do shape your identity.

I don't think I have too much to say here. What's said in this book is said many
times over. The hard part (for me) is internalizing advice, and Sherry's
position as both a business owner and a licensed doctor may make it easier to
trust her advice on psychology, just as a verifiable authority on the subject.
That may make all the difference.
