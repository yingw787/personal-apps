I absolutely loved reading through this book. It brings many of the qualities I
found useful in my discussion on [things to say when you're
angry](/posts/2019/12/06/things_to_say), but evolves them with actual examples
on how to handle difficult situations. I think this book I also kind of skimmed
over, but it's going on my personal bookshelf when I go back home, as a core
reference.
