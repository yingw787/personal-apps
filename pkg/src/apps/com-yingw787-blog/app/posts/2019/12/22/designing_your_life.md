I got this book on the recommendation of a counselor, and it was a good read.
What I liked most about it was the idea of mental reframing, and the idea that a
problem is actionable while a truth is not. I don't have too much to say about
it since this was mostly a skim-through, but there's a corresponding workbook
that comes with it and I'm planning on working my way through that.
