I went to [PyCon 2019](https://us.pycon.org/2019) last week, from Wednesday, May
1st through Thursday, May 9th. It was very fun, and I got to meet a lot of
interesting people and learn a lot of new things. People were super friendly and
open and willing to share ideas. IMHO, and from talking to other people at the
conference, I think Python as a community does a great job at welcoming people
and being observable about things like financially supporting women in tech and
underrepresented minorities. For example, [Guido van Rossum, the creator of
Python, personally mentored Mariatta Wijaya to become a CPython core
developer](http://pyfound.blogspot.com/2019/02/the-north-star-of-pycascades-core.html)
to increase female representation in the core developers community, and the best
Django tutorial besides the official Django documentation comes from [Django
Girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/).
[PyLadies](https://www.pyladies.com/) is also an extremely vibrant group
promoting women using Python; it raised ~\$45,000 during the PyLadies charity
auction this year. Promoting community health, probably more than anything else
the Python community does, is why Python is the dominant scripting language
today.

Here's what I learned about how to best make use of conference time:

- **You absolutely don't have to go to everything listed on the schedule**: I
  came on the first day believing that I could just go to a tutorial. Turns out
  they're \$150 a pop, and require pre-registration, and they were all sold out.
  I was terrified that I would have wasted an entire day just milling about on
  the convention floor and doing nothing.

  I needn't have worried. I randomly walked up to [Curtis
  Maloney](https://github.com/funkybob), and we just started talking about
  random things; he was demonstrating a toy [compression
  algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_compression) he was
  building, and the principles behind [arithmetic
  coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_coding). I also got to meet
  [Amber Brown](https://github.com/hawkowl), as well as [Russell
  Keith-Magee](https://github.com/freakboy3742). The Python language summit was
  also this first day, and many of the core CPython developers were there to
  discuss the future of the language. Guido van Rossum himself stopped by and we
  got a picture:

  I also got to meet [Toshio Kuratomi](https://github.com/abadger), as well as
  [Barry Warsaw](https://github.com/warsaw); together, we got dinner with the
  Instagram/Facebook team at PyCon, including [Carl
  Meyer](https://github.com/carljm) and [Jennifer
  Taylor](https://github.com/dragonminded), where I got to be a fly on the wall
  for a _very_ interesting discussion about Python at scale. This was all
  completely random! And everybody's super nice!

  I should also say that the conference talks are published on YouTube
  (materials and documentation are released on a speaker-by-speaker basis); for
  example, this year's talks are published
  [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxs2IIVXaEHHA4BtTiWZ2mQ). This
  definitely impacted what I chose to do during the conference by making it less
  painful to not attend a particular talk and look for other things at the
  conference.

- **Definitely check out the various Open Spaces hosted during the body of the
  conference**: This ties into my previous point of not planning out everything
  prior to the conference. Open Spaces are decided by people who just show up at
  the conference, and schedules are filled out with pen on index card. Many
  times, these are run by speakers who want to do discussions on their talks in
  small groups, or talks by speakers who didn't get a slot this time around for
  one reason or another, or just FOSS project leaders giving status reports. I
  went to three and a half open spaces; one on CPython profiling and performance
  by [Itamar Turner-Trauring](https://github.com/itamarst), one on the Python
  [**`cryptography`**](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/) by [Alex
  Gaynor](https://github.com/alex) and [Paul
  Kehrer](https://github.com/reaperhulk), one on [the Recurse
  Center](https://www.recurse.com/) by [Allison
  Kaptur](https://github.com/akaptur) and [Elizabeth
  Sander](https://github.com/elsander) et al., and the tail end of one on Python
  at Netflix by [Matthew Seal](https://github.com/MSeal).

- **Volunteer!** I was session chair for three sessions; my job was to hold up
  signs indicating time for the speaker and to moderate Q&A sessions if
  necessary. It was nice to give back to the conference. It was also a good way
  to meet the speakers and have something to talk about in a follow-up email.
  PyCon offers many different ways in order to volunteer, so there should be
  something for everybody.

- **Go to talks by speaker, not topic**: Good speakers can make a _meh_ topic
  extremely interesting. Mediocre speakers can make a good topic very _meh_. I
  missed a talk on API evolution by [A. Jesse Jiryu
  Davis](https://github.com/ajdavis) to listen to another talk at the same time.
  It did not go the way I thought it would; it was the only time during the
  conference I saw people streaming out the door in the middle of the talk.

  On the other hand, some talks are filled, with people banging on the doors to
  get in. [Raymond Hettinger](https://github.com/raymondh) gave a talk on
  [solvers in Python](https://us.pycon.org/2019/schedule/presentation/149/). I
  was walking with a guy to the room. He went to the bathroom. I walked into the
  room. It was packed, people were beginning to line up against the walls. The
  session chairs and runners were telling people to leave; due to liability
  reasons PyCon couldn't have more people in the room than the fire code
  specified. Some people waved to indicate an open seat. I went there and sat
  down. _Damn_, I thought. _That dude's still in the bathroom_.

  While PyCon doesn't have hard and fast registration for conference talks,
  there are a few rules of thumb you can follow to determine which speakers are
  the most popular. At a convention center, there are a number of
  differently-sized conference rooms, at differing distances from the main
  entrance. The talks in the beginning of the conference (e.g. morning on
  opening day), in the biggest rooms, with recognizable names, are generally
  going to be good talks. Talks scheduled during those times in small rooms far
  away from everything else are less likely to be as good.

- **Use Twitter**: I always thought Twitter was a complete garbage fire; when I
  purged my social media accounts, Twitter was the first to go. Parts of it
  probably are garbage fires, but a lot of tech people still use it to keep in
  touch with their network. By contrast, LinkedIn didn't have a whole lot of
  usage, probably because many people there were advanced enough in their
  careers to just reach out to their network for a job, and because LinkedIn has
  _so many_ third-party recruiters sending unsolicited requests. On Twitter,
  it's also much easier to put your personal brand first and foremost, and much
  easier to just "get connected" there and then since you can follow anybody
  without their consent.

  My modus operandi was to collect business cards and then follow up with email
  and LinkedIn requests afterwards, but it took a lot of time and energy to do
  so, and I'm not sure how valuable it is in comparison to a Twitter feed. On
  the other hand, it's much less likely that LinkedIn will fill your inbox with
  too many ads, and if you have somebody's email, they will generally respond to
  a request as opposed to something thrown on Twitter, you have initial context
  as to how you got in touch with somebody, and people may appreciate you're
  deliberate about constructing a relationship. Also, if you don't use social
  media regularly, other people may find it less valuable to follow you since
  there's no interesting content posted on a regular basis.

  I opened a Twitter account. I locked myself out after the first five minutes
  accidentally. I have gotten quite old.

  Honestly the most valuable social media network for developers these days may
  be GitHub.

- **Try out a bunch of different open source projects**: I knew nothing about
  open-source contributions when I first came to PyCon, and the experience I had
  during the development sprints there was fairly encouraging. My goal was to
  ship something during the four days I had.

  (As a strong disclaimer, this is my experience after working professionally
  with Python for 2.5 years, and should not be interpreted as a benchmark to
  measure people's contributions by. If you do get this much done or more, props
  to you, and if you don't, it's ok, nobody bites! I'm also kind of just writing
  this as a log of what I physically did).

  The first project I went to was the [BeeWare
  project](https://github.com/beeware/), which is led by a number of former
  Django core developers like Russell. I went to BeeWare instead of another
  project explicitly because the BeeWare community is extremely friendly to
  beginners (everybody who merges a pull request gets a challenge coin, and
  everybody in the room claps for them), and because the BeeWare project is
  still experimental meaning newcomers have more opportunity to make meaningful
  feature merges. I merged in a documentation fix the first day, and then I
  merged in the ability to select and open multiple folders on
  [`toga-cocoa`](https://github.com/beeware/toga). This led to an interesting
  interface design; [Nehar Arora](https://github.com/nehararora) mentioned how
  file and folder selection used the same endpoints in macOS, while in Gtk
  different endpoints were used, necessitating a change in in top-level
  interface for opening multiple folders after discussion with the BeeWare core
  developers.

  The next project I took a look at was
  [**`securedrop`**](https://github.com/freedomofpress/securedrop), an
  electronic dead drop for whistleblowers. I merged in a new ability to leverage
  property-based testing with
  [**`hypothesis`**](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io), which I thought could
  help the team find any bugs more cheaply. After talking to [Zac
  Hatfield-Dodds](https://github.com/Zac-HD), I added in a test for ensuring
  encrypting and decrypting strings was working properly. Since this leveraged
  primarily well-tested cryptography code such as
  [**`python-gnupg`**](https://bitbucket.org/vinay.sajip/python-gnupg), I didn't
  find any bugs. The tests also took a lot longer to run on the CI pipeline than
  on my local machine (1 minute vs. 400 milliseconds), which Zac said could be
  due to the lack of support for cryptographic hardware on the CI virtual
  machines. Since hypothesis runs about a hundred tests for every stub created,
  this incurred a non-trivial penalty. Finally, since securedrop (wisely, IMHO)
  mostly glues together well-tested third-party libraries, there wasn't a whole
  lot to test with regards to unit tests. The vast majority of tests were in the
  integration test suite. Since `hypothesis` is best at running unit tests, I
  had to lift the deadline for execution in order to avoid the test stub from
  timing out. Otherwise, it was a pleasant experience. The securedrop team is
  very nice, and since everybody was there in the room, changes were merged in
  quickly.

  The last project I took a look at was CPython itself. That was a far more
  bureaucratic process than the prior two projects. I went ahead and addressed a
  documentation issue opened in `bugs.python.org`, but a core developer came in
  and said the underlying issue was unnecessary, and closed my pull request.
  That was mildly upsetting, since I would have liked to merge in a change to
  CPython and become a CPython contributor, but his reasoning was sound. Then I
  took a look at [BPO-36850](https://bugs.python.org/issue36850), which
  fundamentally was an issue with copying over extended attributes and
  permissions from files on network filesystems, and which errors could be
  ignored without data loss. There is a pull request open addressing the
  underlying issue [here](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/8601), but it
  hasn't been merged in yet for over six months. No response from PR owner, who
  also happened to be the module owner. Then the clock ran out. I asked other
  developers how CPython would test something like connecting and copying files
  from a network filesystem, and there weren't many great answers. CPython uses
  a patchwork of free CI pipelines from multiple providers, and I don't think
  there would be any money in setting up an NFS or CIFS client just for testing.
  We could have added unit tests mocking the new ignored error, but it would
  give low visibility into how the connection would actually play out, and so we
  didn't add the test.

  It's pretty insane just how few CPython developers are working on CPython
  full-time: 1 guy (who works at Red Hat). Others are part-time contributors
  whose companies are generous enough to donate 1 day per week for an employee
  to add code, and others just contribute in their free time. BPO, the issue
  tracker, is also pretty archaic. I think if they switched from Mercurial to
  Git, and used a self-hosted version of GitLab, they may get a lot of good
  features to reduce issue management overhead.

  The good things about open-source is that it's very easy to meet extremely
  smart people, and easy to earn their respect, which is huge for building up
  social capital. The bad thing about open-source is that it's hard to maintain
  the discipline for establishing and executing best practices, since the
  projects are far more resource-constrained than I could have imagined.

  This was like a tasting menu for what different projects are like, and what
  different contribution policies and pipelines are like. You can always do
  serious contributions after introductions and orientations are done together!

- **Things are expensive**: I stayed with two friends in the area, and saved
  quite a bit on hotel costs, but since I didn't know how safe Cleveland was at
  night, and since I was time-constrained in the morning to get to the
  convention center on time, I took a lot of Lyft. And there aren't enough Lyfts
  and traffic in the area in order to use Lyft Line, the carpooling service.
  Yea, killed my budget planning for the month. I talked to a Lyft driver and he
  said he only got half of my fee; Lyft took the other half.

  I think next time, I will try and take Lyft for the first few days, in order
  to find a driver I like. If I like a driver, I might just offer them my fee
  directly, in exchange for driving to/from the same locations. That way, the
  driver can get more money, and I may be able to negotiate to pay less total.
  The problem is of course coordination and availability, but it shouldn't be a
  problem since Lyft is always there.

  Food and beverage is apparently insanely expensive. I was talking to [Kushal
  Das](https://github.com/kushaldas) and he said every day of the development
  sprints, PyCon spends \$2000 on coffee _in the first hour_, and \$6000 for the
  day. PyCon spends _\$35,000_ on just coffee during the duration of the
  conference. This is because the coffee has to come from the convention center,
  which has one vendor (StarBucks), meaning no competition; if outside coffee
  was allowed this cost could be cut by half. This is after the Python Software
  Foundation negotiates with cities and convention venues to lower the cost of
  hosting the event, resulting in the convention center having to
  nickel-and-dime the Python Software Foundation (PSF) to try and recoup costs.
  Without money, it's a lot harder to make everybody happy. PSF has no money
  because Python is not a pay-to-play project. Apparently, other open source
  foundations, like the Linux Foundation, get corporate money to include their
  pet features into the project, affecting the technical direction of the
  project, and for Python, that could kill the contributor base.

  I signed up to be a PSF financial contributor at PyCon for \$20/mo., and I
  think it'd be great if returning PyCon members had the option to pay the
  difference for their PyCon tickets between early-bird and regular pricing in
  order to supply grants to people of lesser means and underrepresented
  minorities to attend the conference.

- **The corporate tutorials are pretty good**: Tying into my previous point,
  because of a strong separation between corporations and PSF, there's a
  stronger focus during the corporate tutorials (which are free to attend) on
  useful things to learn about Python in production, rather than pushing a
  marketing product such as a corporate API. Capital One hosted an absolutely
  smashing tutorial on Python performance, represented by [Steven
  Lott](https://github.com/slott56) and [Gil
  Forsyth](https://github.com/gforsyth), which I think had a lot of value and
  didn't have really anything in terms of Capital One branding/marketing.

  (Capital One also paid for coffee during the development sprints after PyCon
  ran out in the first hour, so :clap: :clap: :clap: to them there)

- **Don't fly United Basic Economy**: Don't. Just don't.
