I was made pretty uncomfortable reading this book. I am most comfortable reading
technical non-fiction, not "adult romance". But I read it because it was
Thanksgiving, I forced myself to take a break, and honestly I have to confront
things that make me uncomfortable if I am to grow as a person.

I think the book appeals to a certain kind of audience; I personally could have
benefited more from managing my expectations better. I probably would have
preferred less imagery, and more prose. At times, it sounded like [Reddit's
r/menwritingwomen](https://www.reddit.com/r/menwritingwomen/) because the
descriptions didn't really sound convincing. Not to mention the absurdity of the
plot line in the first place, and how everything seems to come together "like a
glove".

Honestly, I think it is really healthy for me to read more of this stuff. I
don't get out too much and push my boundaries, and having more "wtf -> ah okay I
get it" dances is a good thing. It's quite popular on
[Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34879621-burn-for-you), and it's
an interesting insight into how adults may dramatize romance. Do what is hard,
right? No pun intended.
