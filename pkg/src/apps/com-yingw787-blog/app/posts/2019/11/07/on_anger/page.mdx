This book was a very enjoyable read. What I love about the wisdom of Antiquity
philosophers is how timeless and relatable their advice is, and how readily such
advice can apply to our lives. It's not necessarily that a Caligula-like figure
exists today and holds power over us (as per the quote above), but how anger
itself manifests and what frame of mind one should be in before tackling issues
that rile us up.

There's many common denominators between what Seneca suggests we should go when
we're angry, and what many therapists may mention today. Take a day before
responding so as to not have anger cloud your judgment. Be mindful of where
anger leads and whether you wish to pay the price (see quote above). Be mindful
of your own failures and let them keep you humble. Remember how being merciful
and grateful has earned you goodwill. Trust what you know is true and leave
hyperbole and hence paranoia at the curb.

I think people know this stuff logically. The hard thing is building alignment
between our [System 1 and our System
2](/posts/2018/08/19/thinking_fast_and_slow), and being able to act and
accomplish out of a sense of joy -- no matter the circumstances. That takes
acceptance of some hard truths: that life is not always fair, suffering may have
no purpose, and sometimes we don't deserve things we think we deserve.

Seneca came from a time when the stakes of our actions were oftentimes much
higher than they are today, but where the fundamental truth of his teachings
still hold true. I liked this book, and I think internalizing its teachings will
be healthy for anyone.
