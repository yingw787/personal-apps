I was at an [Indie Hackers](https://www.indiehackers.com) Meetup in Washington,
D.C. last September, where I met two indie founders. One of them mentioned how
he wished he had my foresight at my age and started a company then.

It's almost September of the next year. I'm amazed at how time flies. I
literally thought it was a few months ago since I went, until I double checked
my email by reading this blog post. And guess who still doesn't have a company
yet?

This process has permeated my life. People give me the best advice, and I smile
and nod and let it drift off to the ground. I'm amazed at how much I know ("get
out of bed right when you wake up", "wake up and sleep at strict times", "eat
50% greens, 25% protein, 25% carbs", "build up growth habits so that you can
become 1% better without thinking about it", "put your best foot forward"), and
how little I believe in it (and myself) enough to apply it in my life. Before
long, that advice has become stale, and since people see I don't take the advice
to heart, they stop giving it to me entirely.

What's sad is how old we've become. I'm almost 25, halfway to 30, and feeling
like my life has already slipped between my fingers. And I'm not even comparing
myself to other people (which is always something guaranteed to make you
disappointed in yourself), but rather just to the version of me that could have
been better. So many dumb decisions. So many regrets.

You can't dwell on the past, sure. But the past does help determine who you are
and what you will become. Who you associate yourself with, what you do during
the day, what choices you make. You can always change; but you can never stop
paying interest on who you were.

So some things I want myself to internalize:

-   **Tackle the one thing you fear the most**: Literally just hammer at it
    until it becomes not scary anymore. I think this is a good approach for a
    number of things. Getting over my fear of heights was a big one. Getting
    over my fear of not being able to complete things is another. The one I'm
    working on right now is not being wanted, or not being useful to other
    people (as I've learned, a dangerous position to be in). If you have no
    fears left, does that mean you're happy? Maybe; all that would really be
    left is the fear of being unhappy.

-   **Once you build a habit, don't ever break it**: Better to scream into a
    pillow in the morning than to give up and play on the phone, and lose the
    first ten minutes, or three hours of your day, and break the habit of always
    getting up on time. Good place to levy existing fears to keep these in
    check.

    -   **Brushing teeth**: *Brush your teeth in the evening if you want to keep
        your teeth. Brush your teeth in the morning if you want to keep your
        friends*.

    -   **Exercising**: *One day you will do the last push-up, the last sit-up,
        the last run that you will ever do in your entire life. Wouldn't you
        rather know when that would be by doing more, rather than being afraid
        of the unknown*?

    -   **Sleep**: *Never stay up late to do something you wouldn't get up early
        for*.
