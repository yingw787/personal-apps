I had first learned about "blue-ocean strategy" when talking with the VP of
sales/marketing at my first company (one of the many things I learned while
talking with him). I maintained this curiosity and decided to figure out where
this all began by purchasing the seminal book on blue-ocean strategy.

It was a decently good read. Chan and Mauborgne discuss blue-ocean strategy in
the context of existing firms that compete in red-ocean markets, and need to
update their value chains and propositions to capture growth. For a smaller
company, or a tech startup, whose very existence is defined by a blue-ocean
[go-to-market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_to_market) strategy, the book is
probably less relevant.

Some pointers I got from this book:

- **Building alignment is extremely important**: Alignment is hard to do.
  Organizational processes need to be fair, transparent, and empathetic for
  people and departments to invest in change. This is made harder if there is
  already momentum towards retaining the status quo.

- **Not all innovation requires capital expenditures**: Sometimes, it's
  recombining different pieces of already existing value propositions;
  sometimes, it's changing the target audience. Chan and Mauborgne give the
  example of Cirque du Soleil as a blue ocean innovator in the circus space
  that executes well along these axes. In fact, Cirque du Soleil cut out a lot
  of traditional circus performers and focused on a few key acts, allowing
  them to get the top-of-market talent for those specific niches.

- **Continually pre-fetch information and use it to constantly look for new
  opportunities**: No organization responsible for putting food on somebody's
  table should be resting on their laurels. Understand what the market is like
  out there and what has changed since the last time you made an evaluation.
  Pan for gold nuggets of information, and use them to infuse existing blue
  oceans with better value propositions or create new blue oceans entirely.

This is one of those books where it's better to have it and not need it rather
than need it and not have it. I might refer to this text occasionally, but I
think there are more valuable texts related to sales/marketing specifically in
the technology fields. This is highly informative for one's philosophy, though.
