It really shouldn't be an argument that focusing on profit and sustainability
should be more important than growth for a company -- and yet here we are. Paul
Jarvis does a fair job of doing so in his new book, "Company of One". If you
hadn't yet heard of this third way between burning out running a VC-funded
bullet train and grinding as a cog in a megacorp machine, you should take a
listen; you might like what you find.

I really like this path, but I'm already convinced of its superiority; with that
context, I found Paul on the preachy side. Useful for those not converted, but a
bit annoying to those who have heard the message. I don't think I learned
anything new or particularly useful, and I don't think the book had a cohesive
message overall. I did enjoy some of the statistics in the book, and especially
the quote above hit it home (again). I was disappointed in not being able to
take away much more than this, though; so if you've heard the message, feel free
to support the movement in other ways.
