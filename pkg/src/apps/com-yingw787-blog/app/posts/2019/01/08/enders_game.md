As a referenced text in the [Marine Commandant's Professional Reading
List](https://www.marines.mil/News/Messages/Messages-Display/Article/1184470/revision-of-the-commandants-professional-reading-list/),
it's ironic how the central premise of "Ender's Game" is how Ender _doesn't_
want to hurt anybody. Again and again, after his countless enemies lie dead at
his feet, Ender always wonders why they chose to attack in the first place.
Ender's tragedy is how power itself invites response, and how true power over
your enemy comes from understanding him enough to love him -- and destroy him.

Ender Wiggin is the third child of the family, born after Peter Wiggin (the
eldest) and Valentine Wiggin (the only daughter) failed out of military training
-- not due to intellectual inabilities, but their emotional personas. Peter was
too sociopathic, and Valentine was too gentle. In Ender, the International Fleet
sought to combine Peter's killing abilities with Valentine's human touch. In
this, they succeeded. Ender rose from a beaten kid on the playground to the
dominant commander in the entire Fleet -- by the time he was eleven.

And in this, Ender found no joy. Forced to grow up too early, and surrounded by
people who would rather use him for his abilities than nuture him, Ender always
rejected humanity's notion that peace was not possible, that there is no way out
but war. Whenever he could, he tried reasoning his way out of tight situations.
And when his time came, when his life finally became his own, he sought to make
amends for his actions, proving as adept in peace as he was in war.

Ender teaches us how while we must respect the laws of power, it doesn't mean we
shouldn't build a better world. The hard part isn't making a decision, it's
living with it. A better world, and a better choice, is the only way we could
ever throw off those shackles.
