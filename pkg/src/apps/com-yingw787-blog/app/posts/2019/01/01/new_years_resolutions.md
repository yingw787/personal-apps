Happy New Year everyone! This year's Times Square ball drop was even more
anti-climatic than last year's; all the smoke from the fireworks obscured the
ball so you couldn't see it sliding down the pole. Apparently, it was also the
first time in 30 years that it was raining in Times Square during New Year's
Eve. Not a great omen to 2019, especially considering the political news of the
day and a looming recession. Always another side to a coin, though; political
tumult means fresh blood in Congress and recessions mean cheaper stocks to buy.
So let's welcome 2019 with open arms.

I decided to dispense with the "priority" system and instead divide resolutions
up based on "soft" and "hard" heuristics. Much of the failure to satisfy last
year's resolutions stemmed from inadequate requirements, and this year I am
determined to not make the same mistake. However, I should also appreciate that
some things can't (or shouldn't) be measured for fear of gaming (and playing)
myself.

The "soft" resolutions:

- **Establish more feedback loops for all the activities I want to get better
  at**: I think this is how I will become 1% better every day and prevent
  habit slippage, and how I will be able to accomplish multiple highly
  complex, multistage tasks required of significant, meaningful activities.

- **Minimize the amount of time I regret spending**: Time is the only thing I
  will never get more of, and hence burning time doing pointless things is the
  one pain point that I should not learn to tolerate. Whenever I can, I should
  cut out the amount of time doing frivolous things (e.g. lying in bed looking
  at my phone), and redirect that time doing things I need (e.g. sleeping), I
  enjoy (e.g. date nights or friend brunches), or I wish to do (e.g. starting
  a business, filling in gaps in my computer science education, or tackling
  other fears and anxieties).

I don't think I have any more heuristic resolutions, so I guess they must not be
too memorable and don't fit the definition of "resolution".

The "hard" resolutions:

- **Go on a date, tackling the fear of emotional rejection**: I already have
  some planned for the new year, so this shouldn't be a problem to do per se,
  but carrying this over from last year's resolutions to honor their
  integrity. Going on a date (my first date ever) will still be a game
  changing experience, because it will force me to deep-dive both in
  self-introspection and emotional interfacing with other individuals.

- **Run one half marathon in the summer, tackling the fear of being fat and
  resultant decreased mortality**: While the gym is nice to go to, it's really
  hard to make a concerted effort to go when abs are made in the kitchen, and
  when I don't really want to set dietary or caloric restrictions on myself
  :blush: So over-exercising it is! I heard a friend say a year or so ago that
  half marathons are the perfect long run: short enough to be doable, but long
  enough so that you have to try. I'll register for a half marathon before the
  break is over to hard commit to this goal. It changes the game because it
  will force me to wake up early to train (many races start at 8AM and require
  long commutes), stick to a planned training schedule ahead of time
  (including multiple runs likely of this duration), and force other good
  habits.

- **Become really good at making dumplings, and make a lot of dumplings,
  targeting the fear of being incompetent in home economics**: I think this
  will not only reduce the amount of food I need to purchase (cutting down on
  the financial burden of eating out so much), but also provide a reliable
  benchmark for calculating caloric intakes (1 dumpling = X calories, and I
  know I ate this many today, so therefore...) and close the feedback loop
  preventing me from making progress on getting a fitter body.

- **Lay the groundwork for and begin executing a plan for financial
  independence, targeting the fear of running the rat race for the rest of my
  life**: _This_ really changes the game for me. I am terrified of money
  problems and going hungry or uninsured or vulnerable to political
  corruption, and the only way I see out of this is acculumating a good deal
  of financial, intellectual, and personal capital.

- **Go to PyCon 2019, tackling my fear of intellectual incompetence**: I
  assess my lack of intellectual growth over the past year to be a very real
  threat to future personal growth. If I can't change the game immediately in
  terms of financial capital acculumation (e.g. development of multiple income
  streams), then I need to do so intellectually. I need to prepare for the
  conference by preparing to meet many people and companies and coming out
  with a high intellectual return on financial investment. Since I purchased
  the tickets already, it's no longer a matter of whether I'll go, but what
  return I will see.

No academic resolutions anymore. Address my fears and anxieties first -- then I
will always remember how I made myself feel.
