I missed snow; Michigan didn't snow again for the second year in a row, and I'm
left wondering whether the five to six inches of snow every year we usually got
is a thing of the past. So when it snowed three inches this past weekend, I took
advantage of the storm and went to a snowball fight on the National Mall.

![snowball fight](/img/posts/2019/01/15/winning_snowball_fights_1.jpg)

I did not expect so many people to show up. It was like 100-200 people at least
(the above picture was taken much closer to the end). And I did *not* expect the
ferocity of the fight. There were one or two cheerleaders on both sides, and
every so often they would yell "CHARGEEEE" and everybody would rush the other
side. The snow was just perfect and so sticky, and there was *so much* of it
lying around. It was perfect.

I think there were some lessons I learned or re-learned during this snowball
fight:

-   Finding new fields for fresh snow is important. Over a period of time,
    people were re-throwing the same snowballs thrown by the other side, and
    after the fields were depleted, people kept moving backwards and to the
    sides (coincidentally where the journalists were). The leaders of the fight
    handled this by directing people to a new field when people drifted too far
    away.

-   Make sure the wind is blowing towards your opponent, and not you. I was on
    the wrong side for this and it was really hard to throw snowballs when you
    can't see. On the other hand, the other side could see we couldn't see and
    took advantage of this fact. You could also mitigate this with a pair of ski
    goggles.

-   Get a cheap snowball maker and use it to make snowballs instead of packing
    it with your hands. Gloves are nice but they soak through, and oftentimes
    you can use snow more efficiently and make the snow on your side last
    longer.

    is the one used by some people over at that fight.

-   Make sure to dry your shoes as soon as you get in from the cold. Otherwise,
    your shoes may get moldy in one to two days, which will ruin the shoes or
    your feet. Otherwise, get some boots and snowpants :D

*Have funnnnn!!*
