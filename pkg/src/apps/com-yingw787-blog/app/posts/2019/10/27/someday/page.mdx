The hardest part for me when doing something isn't knowing what to do, but
taking the first step to actually doing it. So for me, this book was
particularly relevant. Sam describes step by step a number of mind hacks in
order to reason your way out of a apathetic stupor, and provides a number of
discrete heuristics to judge where we are on various spectrums (like happiness).

I like this book because it provides a number of concrete steps to how you can
improve your life, which increase in intensity of effort and likely effect. Some
ones I enjoyed are:

- **Clarify what you want**: This is one of the biggest challenges for me; one
  reason I think I get into unhappy situations is because I don't know what I
  want, which means in those situations I'm unhappy with whatever I get.
  Knowing what you want provides a compass so that when you get what you get,
  you have a direction to go in to get happier.

- **Don't Wait for Work You Love; Create Work You Love**: Over the years, I've
  found my identity defined by the problems I chose to face, or not face. I've
  also found that my perception towards my problems not necessarily defined by
  the number of problems I have, but rather the share of problems I want to
  have and the problems I don't have to have. So counterintuitively, if I have
  a lot of problems weighing me down, I consider making more. More problems I
  chose to make change my perception on what problems I currently face, and
  maybe solving some of those new problems will indirectly help solve the
  older ones.

- **Integrate Your Passion and Profession**: I have a very utilitarian
  mindset where it's difficult for me to appreciate things that don't bring
  immediate observable value to my life. I'm working on that, but combining
  passion and profession helps in alleviating that worry and that stress, and
  helps put the enjoyment front and center.
