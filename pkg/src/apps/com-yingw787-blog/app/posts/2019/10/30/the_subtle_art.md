I've found that the best teachers are the ones who have lived the lessons they
teach the hard way, as opposed to gliding along a path to success, because
they're the ones who appreciate the intentionality and deliberateness of
sculpting their mental model. In this, Mark Manson ranks among the very best
I've encountered. There are so many good nuggets of wisdom, and so very little
bullshit, embedded within these pages that it's clear the hardships he's been
through are true and formative.

One look at [this Hacker News
post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20951444), and it's clear anybody can
see there really is no correlation between material success and progress, and
mental / emotional / psychological health. Stressors are common and effective
coping mechanisms are rare, particularly for problems that appear intractable.
Mark does a great job of breaking down problems into things a skeptical
conscious can believe, and weaves these bitter truths into a web of reality. In
this way, the world can break down and things will still be okay.

Mark has a gift in teaching this mindset, and in speaking in vernacular that
resonates with people of his and younger generations. Highly encourage people to
get and read through this book to see how you can improve your personal
psychological failure models.
