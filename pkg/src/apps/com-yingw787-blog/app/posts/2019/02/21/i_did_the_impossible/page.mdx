I never thought I would say this in my entire life.

I am now an AT&T investor.

As of this morning at 9:35 AM EST, I purchased 64 shares of
[T](https://www.nyse.com/quote/XNYS:T) at \$30.85 USD, totalling \$1974.40
(excluding broker fees of about \$5.00). I think I will definitely purchase more
in the future, and it will likely be the primary stock I own.

By all measures, it's a good stock for me to own over the long term, because:

- Its general scale relative to the market; its primary (and really only
  serious) competitor is Verizon, and Verizon is big enough to [purchase the
  head of the
  FCC](https://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=78736). In a
  highly regulated market with high moats, this regulatory capture means
  predictable profits for incumbents.

- A long history of not just paying dividends, but increasing dividends over
  time. [The Sure Dividend Newsletter](https://www.suredividend.com/subscribe/)
  is a great resource for learning more about dividend investing. I'd rather
  keep the dividends than paying it out to my index fund manager when purchasing
  an index fund. In addition, [market capture by index
  funds](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/30AD689509AAD62F5B677E916C28C4B6/S1469356917000064a.pdf/div-class-title-hidden-power-of-the-big-three-passive-index-funds-re-concentration-of-corporate-ownership-and-new-financial-risk-a-href-fns01-ref-type-fn-a-div.pdf)
  have their own dangers, and as more people invest in index funds (a very good
  thing), the reward to risk ratio increases, making totally stable purchases
  financially attractive. Also if I invest and hold a certain amount, I can beat
  the expense ratio of index funds (this purchase cost around 0.25%, beating the
  common index fund expense ratio of 0.5%) I enjoy walking the path less
  traveled.

- Specifically for me, some understanding of the underlying technological
  reality. I know and appreciate that telephone lines are synchronous
  communications networks. This means every call is guaranteed a set amount of
  bandwidth along the entire network for the duration of the call by every
  service along the route. This leads to higher call quality in comparison to
  VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), as TCP is anychronous and packets that
  arrive late are useless to real-time systems, and UDP drops packets; both lead
  to silence and static, which affects call quality. This is something inherent
  to the Internet and cannot be fixed. Telecom network's synchronous nature also
  means feature rollouts take place on a network scale, because every service
  along the route needs to support the increased bandwidth. This forces massive
  upfront capital expenditures and a long-term rollout schedule, which is good
  for building moats and ensuring product stability. It also means the kind of
  [creative destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction)
  seen in other fields of tech are less likely in this field.

So, if all of these are great reasons to invest in AT&T, _why didn't I do it
sooner_?

It's quite simple. I worked at AT&T and **hated it**.

---

The gist of what happened was there was a large hubbub between which network
switch provider we would use, Cisco or Arista. A vice president up high dawdled
on the decision, which meant the only time I could start on the project
(promised in the beginning) was a week before I left. We were slated to use
[OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/), which while it was open-source, was
also quite design-by-committee; I learned this from various OpenStack meetups.
Design by committee doesn't work in software; you kind of need a [benevolent
dictator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life) in order
to establish direction. Finally, AT&T's procurement services were quite slow,
leading me to have to hack together a
[DevStack](https://docs.openstack.org/devstack/latest/) from computers pitying
coworkers could afford to give up. This, combined with mental breakdowns,
roommate difficulties, an asshole assistant manager who literally told me to
"twiddle my thumbs", and bad weather, all made my experience miserable. I
mentioned this as such to a senior vice president. AT&T never contacted me back
about a job, and I was glad of it.

It's not fair to blame the people at AT&T for all my troubles. After all, it is
literally the Frankenstein child of [Bell
System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_System), where "Mama Bell" was broken
up into regional companies, which then slowly merged back together. Like,
literally Frankenstein cobbled from different body parts. The systems and
processes were bad because divergent tech stacks were merged together, and since
senior executives don't want the company broken up again, they behave in a
risk-minimizing fashion. Many people at AT&T were supportive of my career, and I
appreciate it now. But it did leave severe mental scarring, and taught me that
risk-minimizing has its own risks.

---

Which leads us to the present day. So I have some money in my bank account, and
I don't know what to do with it. I know that inflation will eat up the monetary
value if I keep it in a low-interest savings account. I could also be [robbed
again](/posts/2018/10/23/i_got_robbed_for_the_fifth_time) and _not_ get a
temporary credit back. Minimizing risk by storing my money in a digital mattress
will certainly result in the certain risk of depreciation of some sort, either
gradual or sudden.

I looked at Sure Dividend's Top 10 Recommendations and the only stock that I am
familiar with is AT&T's. There's one other technology company there, and the
curators warn it is highly susceptible to business cycles, and competes in a
highly changing market. For the other companies, I either know of competitors
and don't understand their product differentation enough, or they've reached
market saturation and don't have anywhere to innovate (besides slapping on a new
brand).

So.

What to do.

---

I try and break down the reasons for not buying AT&T. It's not a great company?
Sure it isn't -- but good companies to invest in are not good companies to work
for, especially if you're young and desire meteoric growth in your career
trajectory. It doesn't innovate and won't be relevant? Humbug! It still
innovates -- rolling out the next-generation cellular networks isn't nothing. It
also advertises heavily and fights fiercely to keep its territory (one director
I respected effectively said how if Google Fiber really became a threat to AT&T,
AT&T would fight Google in court for every mile of fiber it laid, destroying
Google in its very own Stalingrad). Am I surrendering to cynicism, that I tried
to change the system and in the end the system changed me? A little, okay maybe
a lot, but I live to fight another day, and that means I still get to choose the
hill I wish to die on. I shouldn't take that for granted; I'm not abandoning all
my morals (e.g. I will _never_ invest in a fossil fuels company) and my
increased financial leverage may help turn the tide on issues I do care about.
In the end though, all this reasoning felt like rationalizations.

Then I remember reading ["On Emotional
Intelligence"](/posts/2018/12/28/on_emotional_intelligence) about a CEO who lost
everything, all because he couldn't regulate his emotions:

Jesus. The guy even has the same last name as I do. His story spoke to me. The
ability to detach past actions and current emotions from the actions required
for the future is essential to success. Seen this way, investing in AT&T would
be a demonstrable sign of emotional growth, temprament, and intelligence.

And so that's what I did.

Here's to the future. :wine_glass:
