Remember how I decided to [not get a new laptop after
all](/posts/2019/01/28/revert_macbook_end_of_life)?

Yea, I reversed my position. Again. But this time I went down a different path.
Instead of purchasing an uber-expensive laptop, I went ahead and got an [IBM
Thinkpad T42](http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:T42).

It even came with its own docking station:

Also a USB keyboard and mouse, and the really nice guy from Craigslist even
offered me a ride back to my house, paying a $3.50 toll fee along the way. No,
I'm not dead yet.

A few differences:

- **It cost $50, cash**: A really good deal for a laptop. Much better than the
  \$2600 I paid for the Dell. Also better than the other T42s on Craigslist that
  cost somewhere around \$250-500. I was kind of holding out for a \$10 laptop,
  like [VWestlife's \$7.49 Thinkpad
  T20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YcEycj_50hA), but I don't think that will
  happen. I called a number of Goodwill stores around the area, but all they had
  were newer laptops. At this stage of the game, I think these computers will
  become more expensive as supplies run out and they become collector's items.

- **It's a bit older**: I think these computers were released in 2003. They were
  among the last business laptops IBM made before selling the laptop division to
  Lenovo. It runs Windows XP (quite well, IMHO) and I'm guessing it doesn't have
  any security patches coming its way anytime soon.

- **It's in remarkably good condition**: The guy who sold it to me had it for
  its entire lifespan, and used it to diagnose his car by way of an [OBD/2
  port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On-board_diagnostics). He sold it because
  now they sell handheld diagnostic tools and he got one, so he didn't need the
  laptop anymore. I think I just need to wipe the keys and screen down and maybe
  defragment the disk, and it'll be as good as new.

A done deal. So why did I purchase such an old laptop?

- **Better resource utilitization**: I don't want to pay money for things I
  don't need; I realized that goes for computers as well. How often am I going
  to need multiple CPU cores wherever I go, given that most of my daily
  workloads appear in `top` as one CPU running at any time? Do I need to spend
  network bandwidth visiting ad-ridden websites and reading clickbait? The
  answer is **no, of course not**. For $50, I can execute 1 billion CPU
  instructions a second, I have 2 billion bytes of main memory, and expandable
  disk storage. To want more is frivolous behavior.

- **Greater empathy with end users**: Most people do not use the latest and
  greatest hardware; developers demand it for their day to day work. I can't
  find it now, but I recall a developer using a Thinkpad T60 because it helped
  him develop empathy with his customers, who did not use high-grade hardware.
  At the time, I thought I could probably replicate such behavior using cgroups
  and network throttling, but the more I thought about it, I realized trying to
  simulate slow hardware using new hardware would be extremely difficult, since
  there are so many components. Better to just have old hardware in physical
  form and set a total lower bound to test against. If it works here, it should
  work everywhere.

- **Better system design**: I can use dynamic DNS, OpenVPN, and SSH in order to
  connect to a server and access compute resources when on the move much more
  cheaply than lugging all that compute with me. In this sense, all laptops
  become thin clients to unbounded compute elsewhere, which to me seems like a
  much better design for your personal infrastructure than a set of thick
  clients that do everything.

- **Better resilience**: If I spill my tea or coffee on my super-expensive
  laptop and it got damaged or destroyed, I would become sad or angry. If I
  spilled my tea on this thing, I would still be sad because I can't easily get
  replacement parts, but it's $50. I could throw away the entire laptop and not
  have its cost significantly impact my finances.

- **Security concerns**: Bit of a tinfoil hat here, but as computers have gotten
  more important, the number of people looking to attack them have increased.
  For example, [Intel Software Guard Extensions
  (SGX)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_Guard_Extensions) encrypts a
  portion of memory with a special section of the CPU so that [cold boot
  attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_boot_attack) don't give away
  encryption keys. That is, don't give away to anybody except the U.S.
  government that [plants hardware backdoors into processors at manufacture
  time](http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2013_09_01_archive.html).
  Apparently, the Kremlin has already [moved to electric typewriters to reduce
  the risk of
  leaks](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/10173645/Kremlin-returns-to-typewriters-to-avoid-computer-leaks.html).
  This, in addition to [news that Spectre/Meltdown are too difficult to
  fix](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/149-security/12556-google-says-spectre-and-meltdown-are-too-difficult-to-fix.html),
  makes me extremely wary of modern processors.

  Yes, it's highly unlikely I individually would be a target of such people
  while also not doing anything illegal, and if I was a target, I probably
  couldn't stop such an attack if it was deliberate and sustained. Still, it was
  made during a time where only the people in control of the security apparatus
  and their benefactors would have computers at all in the first place (reducing
  the likelihood they would insert a hardware exploit targeting their own
  people), and having a simpler processor may help me more easily understand how
  to protect it. As we migrate from a country of laws to a country devoted to
  power, and as the laws of power are effectively congruent with the laws of
  physics, the power we can anticipate to possess in the future comes what our
  physical world can provide. Only the paranoid survive and all that.

  As an added benefit, nobody would really want to steal this computer. All they
  would need to do is take a glance at it and drop it on the ground a few meters
  away, because it's clearly so old they can't sell it for parts. As a guy who's
  been robbed a number of times, knowing I have less stuff to be robbed of than
  the next guy helps me sleep at night.

  Better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.
