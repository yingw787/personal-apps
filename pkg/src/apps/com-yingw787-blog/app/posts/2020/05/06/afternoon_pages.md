Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Today I'm feeling rather afraid. Afraid of what, it's hard to say, but it's not
like there's any shortage of things to be afraid about. I think my challenge is
to convert fears into problems, problems into challenges, and challenges into
solutions and achievements. If you find yourself marching through hell, keep
marching, that sort of deal.

I think my fears come from my insecurities (doesn't it always). This statism
from the lockdown put me right in my comfort zone, and my comfort zone is this
North Korea-esque life where I pretty much just eke out a survivalist existence.
Nice thing about it is, it keeps me safe (I think everybody staying home is
living in my world now...). The downside is there's no need for coping
mechanisms and social / people skills if you're always in your comfort zone at
home, and I don't have the means to permanently live by myself. Otherwise I'd be
up in a cabin I built myself in northern Canada with a dog.

So I think I need to put myself out of my comfort zone, one way or another. I've
been thinking about taking up some software freelancing as a way to stretch my
meager savings a bit longer and see whether I can get enough financial runway to
make a SaaS-based product a thing.
