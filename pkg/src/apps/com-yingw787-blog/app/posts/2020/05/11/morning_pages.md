Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

No cute picture today :)

I think one reason my weekends are so unproductive is I need some way in order
to distinguish between weekends and weekdays. I'm working during the weekdays,
and so the clearest distinction for the weekend is that I don't work. Probably
exists subconsciously somewhere, because I feel really bad about myself and my
behavior towards this. I should be doing chores, exercising properly, eating
properly, and doing the other things. Instead, I'm just watching YouTube and
Reddit.

We'll see how today goes. With any luck, I'll be able to make up for the weekend
by working hard during the weekdays. Hard to make up for the cynicism, but life
is all about pushing forward, or something.
