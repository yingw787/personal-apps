Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Agh, don't have any cute baby/puppy/kitten pictures today. But I have been
watching "The Office"! It's really nice. Finished "Business School" (S3E16) just
now. You know, this entire time, as much as I like and maybe envy Jim, I don't
see myself as Jim. I kind of see myself as Creed, and Dwight Schrute, and
Michael Scott. Creed's ability to live under a rock, Dwight's gullability, and
Michael's sense of humor and general awkwardness / weirdness.

Maybe that's why I'm so uncomfortable with myself. But maybe it's not such a bad
thing. I think the fictional folks at Dunder Mifflin Scranton might not get much
right, but the things they do get right matter disproportionately. Focus on
sales, don't tolerate yes-men, and make people matter. If you get those right,
and you're comfortable with yourself, who cares if the world sees you as a
bizzaro freak of nature? Life in many ways is pass/fail, and you simply choose
the metrics you wish to pass or fail on.
