Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

I had a really nice chat with a bunch of old college friends yesterday evening
for a friend's birthday. It's really cool to see where everybody is, and where
everybody's going. It's also a great reminder to see what no matter what, life
goes on, and it doesn't really wait for anybody. One friend is going grad
school. Another is getting married. A third graduated from medical school and is
heading into residency.

Me? I'm sitting at home eating frozen mango pieces out of a mixing bowl. So
there's that, I guess. How _am_ I progressing during this whole pandemic shtick?
Maybe it's just fine being safe, but I guess since I'm doing all this on my own
paid time, I should expect more of myself.

I'm so close to having an initial version of my project ready. There's still so
much application-level code I need to deal with, but I can taste the success in
my mouth. It's honestly a bit infuriating I missed my own deadline, and it's a
pretty big red flag with respect to how much actually needs to get done.
