Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

I think today, I became addicted (or re-addicted really) to this video [on this
BBC weatherman playing
drums](https://www.bbc.com/news/av/uk-england-manchester-52297848/weather-presenter-goes-viral-drumming-to-bbc-news-theme).
I really like BBC dubstep. Here's a dubstep remix I [copied from
DropBox](/music/posts/2020/05/31/bbc_dubstep.mp3). And ahhhhhh there's an HTML
MP3 player! That's so cool.

It's been an..._exciting_...few days recently. I thought [George Floyd
died](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_George_Floyd) last week, and I mean
I guess I would be correct because today's Sunday, but like then I thought he
died last, last week. Nope, just last Monday. I thought [Ahmaud's
death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shooting_of_Ahmaud_Arbery) would be the
trigger, and it was, for some peaceful protests. You know, gunning a guy down
while he's jogging. Then I thought it'd be [Breonna Taylor's
death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Breonna_Taylor), and it was, for
some peaceful protests. You know, gunning down an off-duty paramedic in her own
home during a pandemic and then arresting her boyfriend.

Now, I think everybody's just sick of everything and feel like nothing matters
anymore, hence burning and looting and shooting and stuff.

Strange thing is, all this death and destruction doesn't really piss me off. It
might be because I'm not personally affected and I'm a selfish person who
primarily looks after his own self-interest. It might be because I felt this was
a long time coming and was mentally bracing for this for a number of years.
Maybe it's because I'm so emotional about things I've wrapped back around to
heartlessness.

But if I had to pin this to one reason, it's that I've long stopped thinking
that people can change systems based on altruism. I've been hammering nails into
that coffin for quite a while. That coffin is probably more nails than wood
right now. I mean seriously, I listened to my pastor's address on this matter,
and he's great on most topics (which is why I go to his church), but this
message seriously pissed me off.

_It was so milquetoast, it was enraging._ The most aggressive thing he said was
"God condemns injustice". I don't remember if he mentioned Floyd's death as
unnecessary or cruel. Come to think of it, I don't remember if he addressed the
peaceful protests earlier this year. Maybe I have a bad memory (I do really have
a bad memory), or maybe it's because the Arlington County Police Department
offers protection to our church to prevent mass shootings since [Sutherland
Springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland_Springs_church_shooting) and
the pastor didn't want to tick them off by speaking out of turn.

For me, it definitely underlines the whole ["white
moderate"](https://bennorton.com/mlk-on-white-moderates/) shtick MLK was
steaming about, that people mostly want to stay on the sidelines and not get
involved, and that they'll only do so if it inconveniences them and even then
only to the extent that the inconvenience is lifted from their conscience.

Well, now the gloves are off. The truth is, in any struggle for rights and
freedoms, _there are no referees and there aren't any rules_. In fact, _it's
quite dangerous to not be involved -- the less you're involved, the less power
you have, the less you matter, and the more vulnerable you are to all factions,
police, anarchists, doesn't matter_. So when I see [videos of innocent civilians
shot on their
porches](https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/video/4571653-video-appears-to-show-law-enforcement-shooting-paint-rounds-at-citizens-on-their-porch/),
or [journalists deliberately being shot at by rubber bullets, something that
doesn't happen even in war
zones](https://www.wave3.com/2020/05/29/lmpd-officer-fires-pepper-balls-wave-news-reporter-photographer-during-louisville-protest/),
I see people realizing the futility of appeasement and moderation. You can't sit
this out anymore. That's the only way I see lasting reforms can occur, by
pissing off as many innocent bystanders as possible in whatever way can get them
pissed, as painful and sad as that may be, because it's the only way that
accepts our human nature.

Don't forget, we're still very, very lucky. I believe one point of Syria's Arab
Spring uprising was police / state brutality. Now, I have no idea what people
are fighting about over there. We still have one major faction of peaceful
protesters wanting the right to live we can ally ourselves with. I think
worst-case scenario, that might not be the case in 12 months.

This Bible passage popped into my mind as I thought about all those and all that
we've lost from our collective inaction, ignorance, and selfishness:

> **Cursed is the ground because of you; through painful toil you will eat food
> from it all the days of your life.**
>
> **It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants of
> the field.**
>
> **By the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the
> ground, since from it you were taken; for dust you are and to dust you will
> return.**
>
> Genesis 3:17-19

Now, more than we have been recently, we are all sons of Adam.
