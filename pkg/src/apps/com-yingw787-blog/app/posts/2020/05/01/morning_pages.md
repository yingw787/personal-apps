Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

This is now my new favorite cat video. I don't know how the world will top this.
Maybe if it had sound.

Happiness through a screen. Who woulda thunk?

I have a hard time understanding where I need to be going. Definitely feel
pulled in many different directions at once. I need to get up earlier. I think
my time can be used better. I should try to relax and loosen up. All these
things are important to me, but getting the balance right is hard.

I'm a bit concerned about the lockdown, because apparently we still don't have
enough tests up and running. We haven't made good use of this time, and it'll
just mean that when we eventually stop holding our breath we'll just get smacked
in the face again. I anticipate I'll probably avoid going out unnecessarily
until summer of next year. I think that's the truth, no matter how bad that
sounds. I can't be down and out about this, I have to figure out how to make
this current existence work for myself.

On the good side, besides rent, I can effectively stem the financial bleeding,
and if I can get myself to ramen profitability, I'll be a lot more comfortable
about waiting things out for the long term.

I need to get my habits tracker up and running. With backups. And that means
getting TinyDev shipped. Just have to keep chugging.
