Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

So it's that time of year! Comcast raised their prices on me from $29.99 a month
to $49.99 a month. During a pandemic, when I need access to the Internet. In a
neighborhood with one Internet service provider. I feel rather apathetic towards
the whole thing, to be honest. Why _wouldn't_ Comcast try to raise their prices?
They got me right where they want me.

In better news, I think my project is coming along okay-ish. I hope to have an
MVP out the door by this Saturday, when I might touch base with a mentor for
accountability purposes. If I have an MVP, I can probably start working on the
landing page again. That's still a lot of work to be done, given how my database
is still sitting out on a public subnet in the open. We'll see what happens this
week.

I also went to Trader Joe's for the first time in two, maybe three months. A lot
calmer than the days of panic buying, everybody kind of knows what they're
doing, and I finally get my bread mix and yeast for home baking. That's not bad!
