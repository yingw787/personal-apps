Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Oh look, a Pokemon!

Really like the quality of that mask, looks professionally 3D-printed.

I think I have three layers of website blocking on my laptop:
RescueTime/FocusTime, Leechblock as a Firefox extension, and system-level
`/etc/hosts` forced DNS resolution to `localhost`. I think this is finally
enough to discourage myself from going onto unproductive sites during the day,
because by the time I finally tear off all the protections I decide it's not
worth the effort and go back to work. It's pretty funny, to be honest. I'm
really happy it works for me, and I'm really happy that even though I'm a `sudo`
user (so I have access to everything on my computer), this is still effective.

Also really nice how `reddit.com` makes my CPU fan go on constantly. I can't go
on Reddit because the website will literally wear out my hardware. So that's a
nice check.

I'm feeling hopeful-ish today. This past weekend, I went walking down over to
Rosslyn and to the Key bridge for the first time in a few months, and I took a
picture of the D.C. skyline during the sunset. It's the most I've walked in
quite a while, and I definitely feel my legs burning afterwards. But it's nice
to walk further away from home, it kind of feels like I'm taking my life back in
a sense.

This is what I look like when I go outside these days:

And this is what the D.C. skyline looks like these days:

Not bad. At least, I like it.
