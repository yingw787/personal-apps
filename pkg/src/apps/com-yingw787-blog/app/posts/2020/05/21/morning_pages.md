Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

I just realized that our stay-at-home order, if not extended, will only last
until June 10th. That's pretty amazing that we're most of the way through the
first phase of this pandemic.

...I guess if I put it like that it's kind of a downer, but I think there's a
goodly amount to celebrate! Even for me, I learned how to effectively work from
home, bake bread and make homestyle meals, and otherwise live much more frugally
and meet my own, fairly aggressive financial targets for my sabbatical.

Second and third waves might be a good deal easier to deal with on a technical
basis, if not on a financial level. Biggest problem is if others can't bear the
financial strain (totally understandable) and community transmission becomes a
thing as people have to go about their daily lives and return to work. This
whole ["it might be over by next
June"](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/coronavirus-vaccine-pentagon-memo) could
be optimistic.

You know, after typing all that out, I think I should post a kitten video.

Yesterday wasn't bad! I managed to get up at a reasonable time, and work until
2:00AM in the morning. Today's shaping up to be much the same as yesterday, and
hopefully I'll be able to remain productive over long periods of time. Though I
really should do some life management stuff today.

I really should convert over my blogs and whatnot to use Docker and Makefiles
instead of having bash scripts lying about everywhere.
