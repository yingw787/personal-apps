Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Cute kitty video! With sound! `gfycat` on web is a much better experience than
`gfycat` on mobile, or at least it's better with more CPU and more RAM:

So we got a prompt today, _what is your favorite or least favorite emotion_, and
Ali posted [this feelings wheel](http://feelingswheel.com/) where we can
describe where we are. I think my favorite emotion is "courageous", and the
worst emotion is "apathetic". I like being able to push deeper into things, and
courage is what allows me to do that. Conversely, apathy is what destroys
courage, so I see that as its opposite emotion. I'm most terrified of not
knowing things, even after I'm halfway reading through the Incerto series, it's
a very primal and base fear, and so I really value the ability to push through
that fear to know more about my surroundings.

I'm not quite sure if I've mentioned this yet, but I've been looking at the
state of the world and thinking now is a good time to start a company. It's not
really an explainable feeling, and it's not a rational one either. But I feel
compelled that I should start a company and try really hard to be free, truly
free. And to attain that freedom, I'll start a company, and if it fails another,
and another, until I win, or until the chances are spent.

It seems funny, the childhood days of lying in a basket and playing with mom
like that kitten above seem rather far away. Now we have responsibilities, our
bones aren't made of cartilege anymore, and things seem more worn and familiar.
I wonder if the innocence that leads to curiosity can really ever come back, or
whether we have to craft it in a lab in the mind like some sort of Frankenstein.
I guess we'll just never know, unless we have the courage to push forwards.

To finish off morning pages, here's a poem by [Reddit user
u/SchnoodleDoodleDo](https://www.reddit.com/user/SchnoodleDoodleDo/) on [this
Reddit post about a cat becoming a
mom](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/gdg0el/a_proud_mom_cuddling_her_newborn_babies/):
