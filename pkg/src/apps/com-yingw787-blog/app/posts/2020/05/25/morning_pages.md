Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

I have a giant thing of mini potatoes and I'm looking to cook them. Apparently,
boiling things in water + baking soda, then putting them into an oven, is a
highly underrated cooking strategy. Like [this
recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2016/12/the-best-roast-potatoes-ever-recipe.html)
or [this one on oven-baked chicken
wings](https://thecookful.com/bake-chicken-wings-crispy/), involve the use of
some form of baking powder or baking soda. Which is interesting.

I don't know what to do about my weekends anymore, but I can't really relax or
work during those days. Apparently, I just lay on my bed and watch my phone for
the whole day, or my computer if I don't have my phone available. I think it's a
combination of multiple things. I'm stressed out about my project and I want to
get it done, and I'm *still* a good deals away from that. I put a lot of
emotional investment into this project, and I'm scared that if it goes down a
lot of that investment goes down as well. And I'm tired from the week in general
and I guess I'm subconsciously figuring if I'm going to run out of steam, I
should do so on Saturday and Sunday.

I guess one reason I keep trying to push myself is I know the truth doesn't care
about my feelings. If my project isn't done, then it isn't done, period, and it
doesn't matter how much effort I put into it or how I feel about the project one
way or another.
