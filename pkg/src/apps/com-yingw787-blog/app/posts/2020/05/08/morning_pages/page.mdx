Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

This is a nice doggo.

<VideoPlayer
  sources={[
    {
      src: "/video/posts/2020/05/08/morning_pages.mp4",
      type: "video/mp4",
    },
  ]}
/>

Apparently Reddit uploads iOS videos as `.m3u8` format, which are tricky to
handle and to convert to `.mp4`. I like gfycat now.

It's Friday, and another week gone. Time is passing by insanely quickly for me
and I wish I could slow it down somehow. I could use the extra time. The hourly
journal I've been keeping of my day helps a little bit, but I think
psychologically being in the exact same environment day after day probably
contributes to the subconscious "sameness" I've been feeling. I'm also having
trouble timeboxing specific tasks, especially since some tasks are blockers for
others. I feel like I just need to get over this one little hill, I'm sooo
close, and then things can finally relax a bit.

Maybe I'm lying to myself, but this is honestly how I feel. Only time will tell
if I'm right, and I hope that day doesn't come until I'm ready.
