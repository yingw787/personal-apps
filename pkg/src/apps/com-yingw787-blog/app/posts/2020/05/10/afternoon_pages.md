Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

This is delicious:

Well, maybe not. There's an interesting new video format called `.m3u8`, and I
haven't really figured out how conversion to `.mp4` will work. Instead I've been
using an online video conversion tool.

This weekend has been...uneventful I'd say. Time is definitely blending
together, and it's difficult to concentrate on what matters. What I really
should do is go outside right about now, or maybe boil some eggs so that I can
get some oomph into my diet. There's a bunch of things piling up on my to-do
list, and I feel like the higher the pile, the less interested I'm in in dealing
with it.

Yeah, I think I'll just go boil some eggs. I need to eat something today.
