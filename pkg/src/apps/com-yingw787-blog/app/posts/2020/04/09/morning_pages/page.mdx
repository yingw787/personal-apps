Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Looks like denim isn't just for the 90s anymore :smile:

Yesterday, I got a gigantic grocery delivery from my parents. It was like $200
worth of stuff. Really glad I don't have to go out and buy my own groceries
during this time, and really thankful for my parents and for the delivery folks
over at Instacart who were wandering around in Costco on my behalf. This time, I
remembered to tip them and tip them well for their service.

Decontaminating groceries does put a strain on me for some reason. Maybe I'm out
of shape, or just tired and distracted, but it took me 45 minutes to wipe down
most of the stuff initially and about the rest of the day in order to clean up
the mangoes, strawberries, and mushrooms (in fact, I still need to clean up the
strawberries and mushrooms). I think the problem is because the shoppers have to
dart in and out of the store to satisfy existing demand and to avoid catching
any virus, some of the perishable product selection isn't as good as it usually
is, and since I've been eating more frozen foods, I'm not as familiar with
preparing perishables for storage. For example, apparently mangoes have seeds,
and not just regular old seeds, they have some weird-looking seeds too:

So I had to go watch a video on how to cube mango up for freezer storage while
having a bunch of overripe dripping mango on myself. I'm not complaining, I'm a
finger licker, but it was an interesting experience.

Strawberries and mushrooms I will complain about, because they perish so fast. I
think half of them were soft and gray-ish already. Apparently mushrooms will
dissolve as well. I wish I could get like frozen mushrooms or something. Frozen
strawberries I have tried, but they're literally _raw_ (like full-on white
unripe) and then blasted with nitrogen in order to look fresh. Strawberries are
lies.

I do have some steak in order to tide me over. As soon as I finish prepping
those darned strawberries and mushrooms, I think I might fry myself a piece of
steak in order to celebrate. I used to keep steak around in order to celebrate
"something special". Ended up waiting 2 years for nothing to happen. So now I'll
just celebrate small things. Like going outside to toss my trash / recycling,
and doing my laundry. Or cleaning my apartment. Or reading my book and working
on my software project.

My dreams have started becoming a bit more vivid. Today's dream was (again)
about having both success and freedom, and being able to visualize what that
looks like. Wouldn't that be nice. Helps in getting up in the morning, no matter
how tired I feel.
