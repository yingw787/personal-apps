Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

---

So yesterday, discovered that not only did my habit tracker app update (against
my will, again), it also broke a number of habits (again), and I have to
snapshot my habits into my notes app manually. I really hope I can release some
sort of an MVP for TinyDev soon, because my personal need is quite urgent. I
really can't afford to divert attention for things that keep breaking.

Also missed Morning Pages two days in a row now. Not sure what it is with me and
getting up early in the morning, but I just can't seem to do it if my phone
isn't locked up.

Otherwise, yesterday wasn't too bad. I got a lot of chores done, and I finished
the first draft of my blog post and sent it off to a content editor for review.
Hopefully response will be quick, but I have the material down and I think now I
can focus on learning the material I need in order to ship my project. Here's
hoping today's gonna be just as good.

Here's Mr. Kitty:

Mr. Kitty knows time should be both precious and well spent. Look at Mr. Kitty.
And be happy.
