Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

I think two kittens might be better than one. Especially if they're hugging each
other.

I don't feel too shabby this morning. I finished reading that DevOps book I've
been thinking was blocking my path to actually shipping some sort of backend for
my project. I can plan out my routine, and my
[boss](https://bossasaservice.life/) is helping me plan out my week in
anticipation for the weekend. Things aren't going too badly.

I need to balance my house chores along along with my studies. I don't think
it's too productive to just make a CVS run whenever, and that means knowing when
exactly I'll run out of dish detergent. I also want to know what kinds of
projects I'll be working on after I finish TinyDev and my habit tracker / key
rotation reminder tool / digital Rolodex. I think it might be some form of
CloudFormation template deployment using a Typeform-like interface. I went on a
mini-shopping spree on Amazon and purchased a domain name `formdeploy.com` and
two boxes of dishwasher detergent pods and some batteries. Total rich person
spending.

The days kind of do seem to just roll on by. I do hope these days are worth
remembering. And even if they don't, I hope they make me feel good for the days
ahead. Too much to ask? I'll ask anyways, what's the worst that can happen?
