Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

I like this picture. Quite a bit.

It's not a good idea to eat twelve crossiants in three days, and I don't think I
have anybody to blame but myself. Sure, the underlying reason is because due to
space constraints in my refrigerator and poor planning on my part the crossiants
sat right above a raw steak in a dish on a ledge, and finishing them off made
good use of the food while it was still decontaminated, but the truth is I don't
really have too much impulse control. Same with the bananas and the mixed nuts.

My popcorn habit has dried up though. I purchased a bag of raw popcorn kernels
and now I'd have to follow the instructions in order to make my own popcorn.
It's not convenient, and it might even be a little dangerous, and that's why I'm
processing that craving in moderation (unlike so many others).

I also got a heatmap from [Boss as a Service](https://bossasaservice.life/)
after communicating my hourly journals. Really appreciate the top-notch service
they're offering. Here it is:

Usually, in my journals when there is unproductive time I label it as `N/A
unproductive`. Sometimes when I'm doing chores or otherwise taking some personal
time I label it is `N/A misc` or `N/A chores`, and when I'm sleeping and not
actively tracking something I mark it as `N/A`.

Some things I learned about myself include:

- **I'm definitely not getting up on time.** I want to get up at 7:00AM, but I
  have next to no energy to do this. There's a number of reasons for this. Due
  to my phone addiction, I keep my phone locked up until 11:30PM, so that I can
  keep my phone usage to 3 hours a day (typically on the weekends, when I don't
  lock up my phone, it can go up to *15 hours a day*. Yeah, that's right, I
  can't even get out of bed). I have a conversation with my parents every day,
  and because my phone is locked up and I don't have VoIP-based SMS + voice I
  have to wait until my phone is unlocked until I can call. Which puts my
  bedtime around 1:00AM, which is far too late to wake up at 7:00AM.

- **My mornings are pretty shit.** The sooner I wake up, the longer I take in
  order to get stuff done, because the groggier I am. I'm usually not a morning
  person anyways.

- **I only get about 5 hours of productive time in a day.** That's between
  12:30PM and 5:30PM, with degraded performance between 5:30PM and 9:00PM, and
  pretty much no juice between 9:00PM and 11:00PM. Mornings are garbage.

I think from this heatmap, I can derive some actionables:

- **Commit to waking up at 7:00AM, as tracked my by daily morning photo +
  affirmation.** I'm terrified I'll just keep missing this commitment and it
  will never get done, but I think it's important to make and to shoot for.

- **Get three hours of work done before noon, as tracked by my hourly journal.**
  Again, not sure how realistic this is, but I think it will go a long way
  towards establishing a reach goal. If I do manage to get up @ 7:00AM, that
  means I have five hours of time, two hours of time to spare.

I could create more, and I have, but I deleted them because I think the mornings
are the key. Two weeks of waking up at 7:00AM will go so, so far towards having
productive days, and being able to forgive myself for relaxing.
