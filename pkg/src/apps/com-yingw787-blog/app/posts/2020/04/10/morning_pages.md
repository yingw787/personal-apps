Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

This kitty is judging me for coming to Morning Pages late again.

Stop judging me, I like my beauty sleep :sleepy:

Yesterday was interesting. I was wondering what would happen if I got up at the
time I naturally wake up because the sun shines into my southern bedroom window
(around 7:00AM). Turns out, time feels really weird on five hours of sleep. I
heard that time passes quickly because your brain doesn't really register
things, which meant that sticking to my hourly journal really helps. I'm
definitely not in college anymore.

Two days after I got a massive shipment of groceries, I have one banana left out
of two bunches. Which means I ate almost one bunch of bananas every day for the
past two days. This isn't really something I'm proud of, but I needed the
courage. I call them courage bananas. Every banana I eat is a small reward which
pushes me to do something, whether that's more work after some phone browsing,
or to do chores and have to bump into every virus-laden thing outside. Because
now the ground is virus.

April has been really beautiful around these parts. Apparently Michigan is
snowing and hailing for some reason, but D.C. has been *fineee*. This is almost
better than California weather. I'm not complaining about the pollen this time
around, because my windows are sealed shut to allow the furnance to run to burn
out my sore throat and cough, so I just get sunshine and flowers and green
bushes outside my window. I wish this weather would last forever.

I might finally go fry up a steak today. Courage steak.
