Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Look at this baby non-conformist!

Gotta start them early if you want them to break the mold.

I have to say, Linux support for battery / CPU / memory management out of the
box could use some improvement. I'm at 11 GB of RAM used up just by running
Firefox. This is crazy! I'm really glad I got my RAM when I did. Now I just have
to listen to my annoying fan.

I went to go get some voter registration papers in the city because I have no
printer, and to put it mildly, everything's just _mildly_ apocalyptic. Every
restaurant is saying how they deliver here, I didn't know Verizon had steel
shutters in one of the wealthiest hoods in the region, and the government
building is almost deserted and only populated by homeless people (who were very
polite by the way). People were kind of looking at me funny, but at this point
it's them who need to get with the program and not me. I've been wearing a mask
since beginning of March! Don't look at me.

It's kind of [funny and sad](https://www.reddit.com/r/FunnyandSad/) that I spent
two hours walking to go get voter registration papers, in order to vote by mail
in a [post office that might not exist by
October](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/united-states-postal-service-post-office-money-october-coronavirus-pandemic/),
for a [Congress that might also not exist by
November](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-threatens-to-adjourn-congress-it-would-be-unprecedented/).
For all those who think "no it can't happen", remember, _it's just a flu_ :wink:

If I had to describe why I would do this, I guess it's because I see this as my
job. I became a citizen, didn't just get it, so I see this as just another item
on my todo list. Apparently [some people say it's incredibly safe to go out to
vote](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/wisconsin-speaker-robin-vos-2020-elections),
and [so they did](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-52279608). And so
will I.
