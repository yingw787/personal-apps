Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

I think this cake is pretty cute:

Well, this weekend was pretty catastrophic. I think I got up @ 9:45PM on
Saturday, and 7:00PM ish on Sunday. I think this is a thing now. I can't
function on the weekends. I think this happened because I feel like I can't
relax unless I actually have traction on my project, and it's been so long since
I've touched my own project that I don't know how to relax anymore. So I don't
really relax, I kind of just "crumple", if that makes any sense. I also find
myself going to bed later and later, and while I remain productive in the
evenings, I've also noticed I only really start working on tech stuff in the
afternoon (starting around 1PM or so), vs. the 9AM start time I'm aiming for
(and the 6:30AM target wake up time in order to get my morning chores out of the
way). It's pretty darn hard to forgive myself and I find this whole situation
eating into my mental health. How the hell can I bite off more than I can chew
in this situation anyways?

I ended up doing a whole bunch of reports at 1:00AM this morning, which coupled
with the fact that being tired in the morning loses the whole day and the rainy
weather from this morning, meant I didn't wake up in time for morning pages,
third day in a row. This sucks, no doubt. There's really no other way to put it.
I hate everything about this.

But there's no use crying over spilled milk, and there's still the rest of the
day to execute on. So do a good job there, and hopefully things will turn out
fine.
