Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Look at these two! Parent and baby! So smol, so adorable.

You know, after this past weekend, I thought things were going to be terrible.
Maybe it is for the world, but I've surprisingly recovered much better than I
expected. Total couch potato on the weekends, to 10h @ 70% productivity every
day plus time for offline chores. It might just be because I'm reading a lot and
working through previously defined examples lately, I know my productivity was
kind of bad in February and March because I was flailing around with ops issues,
but now things don't seem to be all that scary. Calm before the storm? Calm
after the storm? Who knows.

Today's also good for a number of other reasons. Made steak for a second day in
a row, along with eggs, and while it wasn't great, I learned a lot of lessons
(overcooked it, _don't_ add extra oil or you will set off the fire alarm, garlic
doesn't brown it blackens and chars, cook the eggs before cooking the steak). I
also got 64GB of RAM, which I successfully added to my laptop and which the OS
successfully registered. Hopefully that puts an end to the Firefox issues for
the time being.
