Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Today I'm feeling...restless. I think yesterday didn't go so well in terms of
productivity (and honestly many days I've spent haven't). I'm conflicted.
Productivity has always been my #1 concern ever since I was a kid, but now I
hope I've learned enough in life to know work isn't everything. Because if it
is, I haven't been measuring up, and because I find happiness in other parts of
life too. Maybe it's because I added yet another layer of site blocking, and I
can't peruse sites like Hacker News without encountering [Leechblock
NG](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/leechblock-ng/)'s warning
message. I haven't been exercising nearly as much as I should, and I probably
have pent-up energy from that. I haven't been on a run since forever!

In good news, yesterday I figured out how to retrieve my Windows 10 Professional
for Workstations product key from my UEFI firmware. That means no calls to
Lenovo support or Microsoft support, which were truly...not great for an
impatient person like me. If I need access to Windows 10, I'll have it at my
beck and call. Also figured out one extremely crucial work-related task (getting
my CloudFormation compute layer to work properly), which was pretty much the key
towards unlocking progress on my MVP. Hopefully I can turn the end of the
beginning into the beginning of the end for this project.
