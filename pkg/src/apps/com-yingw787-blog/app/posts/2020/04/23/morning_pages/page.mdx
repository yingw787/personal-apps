Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Folks, there's a cuteness market on the interwebs whether we like it or not.
Some days are just cuter than others. I think I need a savings strategy for
cuteness, to put into my cuteness bank, to tide myself over during times where
there aren't as many cute pictures and videos.

Today's not that day though! Here are _two_ videos and a picture!

Look at these two little guys! Time don't mean nothing to them:

Time _does_ mean something to these little ones though, they're taking the time
to nap:

I woke up at 6:15AM today. After sleeping at 2:00AM. And I'm wide awake, because
I had a horrible nightmare. I worked for `$MEGACORP_NAME` and I "surrendered my
freedom for a few extra bucks". Honestly, this was probably the most terrifying
nightmare since I had those ones about `$RACHEL`. Maybe even a bit more so.

Here's an [LWN.net comment on Linux kernel
lockdown](https://lwn.net/Articles/818402/) that kind of describes what I'm
going through. I guess I'm firmly a
[deontologist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deontological_ethics), I really
like having the freedom to shoot myself in the foot because it gives me more
freedom. I have managed to shoot myself in the foot many times. Wouldn't give up
my freedom. I guess that is why, after two months of working on TinyDev, I'm
still working on it, going down to _defining my own VPCs and subnets, and quite
possibly my own routing tables, DHCP options, ACLs, and CIDR blocks_, because I
can't imagine granting control of something like that to somebody else.

TinyDev is a dashboard slapped onto a database. It's not meant to be hard. But
it is. It's not like I can't do things quickly. I mean, just yesterday, I
shipped this app on Netlify for a volunteer COVID-19 thing in two hours. I
think...I think I just ship quickly when I don't care as much, as bad as that
sounds.

I mean, how can you _not know things_? There's no excuse, you're a sentient
human being. Yet if you got a pre-frontal lobotomy and relied purely on primal
instincts, you might be better off.

I have a hard time reconciling this fact. Maybe it's not meant to be reconciled.
Right now the fear is so primal I pretty much burst out of bed in a cold sweat
and made some tea. First time all year that's happened. I guess I'll take it,
because I've been meaning to start my day at 7:00AM ever since I started doing
so last year (and fell out of the habit when I went home for Christmas break).
