Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Look at me. I am the captain now.

Yes you are!!

A reminder to all who need to hear it, that going 4 hours of sleep and spending
the entire day awake isn't a great idea. Time feels quite weird, and I noticed
that my schedule was pockmarked with little bits of unscheduled rest, or where I
literally didn't know where my time was going. Also woke up late today, which
meant I missed morning pages. No reason to beat myself up about it, but it's
something to watch out for.

Today I feel...normal. I guess this is kind of the new normal, and probably will
be for me at least until the end of the year, but it feels rather eerie to have
this sense of calm. Probably nothing to worry about, and if it is, not a *whole*
lot I can really do about it.

So, cat pictures it is.
