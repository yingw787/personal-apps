Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

__________

Hmm, I saw a video of some German Shepherd puppies crawling around that I
thought was super cute, but I can't find it at the moment.

I think yesterday went better than I could have hoped. It's really, really nice
to have a study buddy during the weekends in order to boost productivity. I
ended up spending a few hours with somebody in order to see whether we could
roll our own teleconferencing solution. The answer is yes, but the financial
cost is, well, no. Unless we deploy our own video / audio server, in which case
yes if we can guarantee it turns on only for the duration of the meeting, where
the cost would be a few cents per session regardless of number of participants
or the session length. For me, this is another valuable data point behind how I
might benefit strongly from having a suite of CloudFormation templates to deploy
specific applications readily and easily.

I don't like how my mom says I should stay home for the next two weeks no matter
what because the virus lingers in the air for a maximum of 24 hours. But I also
appreciate and understand the severity of the situation. My parents are looking
at models which make the high point sometime in mid-April; I'm thinking it might
be early May or later given how some states are still not yet locked down.

I do have a number of other technical items on my backlog of things to do today,
and hopefully I'll take a good swing at them.
