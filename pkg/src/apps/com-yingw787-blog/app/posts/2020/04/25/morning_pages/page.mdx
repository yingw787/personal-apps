Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

So I went to my first virtual speed dating event yesterday! It was an
interesting experience. If you are rejected, it's much better to be rejected in
person vs. ghosting or playing the numbers game via online dating apps. It's
$10, and probably not the most responsible use of my time, but it's something to
do and something new to explore and try out. We'll see if I get any matches come
Monday.

I did learn that Peloton apparently is running a 90-day free trial for anybody
that signs up before the end of April, and you don't need to have the actual
exercise bike or anything, they do just online classes too. That's really cool!
According to the mentioner it's an uplifting and quality experience to behold. I
think I'll add that to my todo list.

I should also make a list of favorite things! That way I don't have to come up
with them on the spot. Though I still might, just in case my tastes change over
time.

- **Favorite movie:** The secret life of Walter Mitty
- **Favorite TV show:** The Office
- **Favorite singer:** Ed Sheeran
- **Favorite food:** Steak and eggs
- **Favorite place:** Anywhere with mountains
- **Favorite book:** Harry Potter series
- **Favorite hero:** Fred Rogers

Not sure if I'm boring and have boring tastes, or if I'm suddenly more exciting
than I was in my much more Luddite youth, but it is what it is and I'm not
apologizing for it. If nice guys finish last (which I doubt), I'll be happily
walking over the finish line sipping a lemonade. Or maybe a tea, that's better
for your health.

One thing I did notice is how some (not all, but a number) guys seemed
pretty...boisterous...at the event, talking about rude experiences or the
quality of the website. I try and not feel those things myself because the
dating market is the quintessential [lemon
market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Market_for_Lemons) where the bad eggs
get left on the shelf for the longest and I'm on the market to get off the
market. I am glad that I (feel?) much more calm than I used to. Maybe me from a
few months (or definitely a few years) ago would have blew a gasket because of
some minor thing. Now things just don't look to be as big anymore. Not sure why
that is, but I think scar tissue doesn't have nerves, so :man_shrugging:

I still have a good deal of work to do today. One thing I promised my
accountability person is how my weekends are complete garbage in terms of how I
spend my time. I think this week I finally lost any real semblance towards what
day it is, and since I didn't finish my goals for this week, I think it's
appropriate to work on those goals for Saturday. So, barring massive numbers of
online shipments (like...four today) and subsequent decon procedures and
what-not, I'll be able to accomplish those goals and then have a relaxing
Sunday, to get ready for the rest of the week.
