Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

This little one just opened his eyes!

I signed up for a virtual speed dating event this Friday. Apparently $10 buys
you 10 minutes, 2 minutes each with 5 different people. I'm not sure whether the
men's event is for men...or with men...I emailed them to ask because I feel like
some clarity will help make the experience better since you can't really assume
gay and straight dating in the city.

I'm feeling apprehensive this morning. It'll be my first time standing on my own
two feet and not following a book or tutorial in around two months or so. I
worry that I'm not going to be as productive as I think, or that what I wanted
to do (build out a bunch of CloudFormation stacks representing multiple
different layers in my app) just isn't possible. I worry that a lack of momentum
will kill my motivation like it almost did when I discovered problems with
Fargate and the `ecs-cli` CLI method of doing things just wasn't going to cut it
for my operation.

But I'm not going to give up. I am far from ready from giving up, not just
because I'm too far into the weeds now and I need to have something to prove,
but because psychologically I don't really see too many different ways out
besides being able to have the skills to monetize what I build myself. So I
guess I'll just keep pushing forward, whatever the cost, and hope to heaven that
there actually is another side.

I walked over to a more populated section of the city yesterday, and I think the
word "temporarily" is a bit misused, given some of these companies might never
re-open. I like the optimism though! And as long as the grocery store doesn't
shutter its doors, which given the spike in demand I think is unlikely, I won't
miss too much.
