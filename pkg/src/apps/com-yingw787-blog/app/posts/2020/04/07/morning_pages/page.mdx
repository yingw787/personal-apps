Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

This was me this morning, except much less cute.

Yeah ended up missing most all of the morning. I think I'm at the point where 30
minutes of deviation from the time I go to sleep causes problems in my circadian
rhythm. Maybe, if I tell myself that maybe I'll go to sleep on time.

Yesterday was surprisingly productive. I was pretty happy with myself at least.
The one thing I'm not too good at is learning how to relax. I timeboxed myself
some time to watch a movie yesterday, and I picked "Rise of Skywalker" and
watched some snippets. My God, is that movie trash, it was worse than any "Star
Wars" movie I've watched. So glad I didn't cough up money to go see it. I should
go pick something else to do, like learn my ukelele. I have to learn one song,
otherwise I'll be embarrassed in front of other people tomorrow and I can't have
that.
