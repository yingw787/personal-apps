Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

I don't know what this little guy wants, but whatever it is, I'll give it to
him:

I'm so happy to be finally done with templating out this infrastructure PoC
yesterday. I can deploy a PostgreSQL instance to Amazon Web Services, in a
container, onto an AWS EC2 instance, with a persistent bind-mounted EBS volume,
with EC2 autoscaling groups and rolling deployments. Yeah I could have worked
through the tutorial AWS published on this topic in a day or two, but after
reading through _Docker on AWS_ I have a much stronger grasp of the topic and
why it's important. I also have agency in automating deploying everything by
myself now, too. I'm pretty happy with this result.

This isn't the end, and this isn't the beginning of the end, but I hope it's the
end of the beginning. With the foundation poured, everything else should be
easier, especially with a newfound confidence that I'm following best practices.
