In 400 or so pages, Professor Taleb shatters your worldview and rebuilds it with
"The Black Swan", or a book describing the significant impact of highly
improbable events. The timing couldn't be better, as the coronavirus pandemic
and the subsequent economic cratering is quite the black swan. Just take a look
at the trend lines for recent initial jobless claims:

There's two spikes next to each other. One spike is 3 million claims two weeks
ago, which shattered the previous record shattered sometime in the 1980s. That
week was then shattered by last week which was around 6 million claims. The
previous record was \<700,000 back in the 1980s.

Two things I learned from reading this book were:

- **Beware the Ludic fallacy.** Your probability of your ability to weigh
  probabilities may be flawed. Professor Taleb brings up the story of Fat Tony
  (street smart) and Dr. John (book smart). When asked what the probability of a
  coin landing tails up if it landed on heads 49 times already, Dr. John
  immediately exclaimed "50%" because probabilities are separate from each
  other, while Fat Tony said "\<1%" because _he assumes the coin is rigged to
  land heads_. Dr. John used a probability model that would completely break if
  the (unspoken) assumption of a fair game was relaxed. Don't be like Dr. John.
  Be like Fat Tony, and apply credibility factors to your assumptions.

  On a similar note, anytime you see a Gaussian model, especially one that
  changes completely after adding one more parameter, run. Nothing in the real
  world depends on only two parameters.

- **The more you know, the more blind you become.** The turkey raised for 1,000
  days on grains and eats out of the farmer's hand is wholly unprepared for the
  1,001st day when the farmer slaughters and roasts it for Thanksgiving. Yet if
  you used the prior 1,000 days to project what would happen on the 1,001st day,
  ending up on a dinner plate wouldn't even be on your radar. You can't reason
  how inevitable a situation is from prior information, same as you can't reason
  what shape an ice cube was before melting into a puddle.

  It also demonstrates the power of information asymmetry. Thanksgiving is a
  Black Swan to the turkey. It is a holiday to the farmer.

Three things I took away were:

- **Build in redundancy towards any actions you take.** This might be keeping
  computer backups and practicing a 3-2-1 backup strategy. It might be exploring
  how to gain additional streams of income or information. It could be living a
  healthy life even if you have "good genes". It could even be storing and
  reserving food (or toilet paper) during times of plenty, so you can prepare
  during times of famine.

- **Use the barbell strategy to plan against Black Swans:** Use a
  hyper-passive strategy coupled with a hyper-aggressive strategy in order to
  protect against the downsides of Black Swans, while still taking advantage of
  the Black Swans that might benefit you. A financial barbell strategy might
  look like dollar reserves and U.S. Treasuries (or gold bars under your bed),
  and investing in biotech ventures or tech companies.

  As a counterexample, I sold my stake in Zoom and kept my stake in AT&T some
  months before this recession as a form of safety and stability. With the
  ongoing pandemic, 33% of cable subscribers would unsubscribe if there were no
  sports on TV. This might permanently crater AT&T's market capitalization due
  to losses in the recent DIRECTV acquisition. Meanwhile, Zoom doubled during
  the pandemic because everybody needs to work at home and their video
  teleconferencing platform is top-notch. Don't be like me.

- **The more you rely on universal truths, the safer you'll be.** I very much
  trust hard sciences like physics, because each theory builds on the prior one
  and Black Swan events in physics (i.e. general relativity) are relatively
  rare. I would trust but verify complex and opaque topics like modern medicine
  (which may prove [iatrogenic, or harms more than
  helps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iatrogenesis)) or my own background of
  computer engineering (which I've learned is getting rocks to think, a tricky
  proposition).

  Despite an amateur background in economics, I don't trust the vast majority of
  economists and produced economic theory at all, due to wildly differing models
  that quickly get invalidated (an indication of overfitting). In those
  situations, I prefer the simplest approach I agree with, which right now is
  John Maynard Keynes (pay people to dig holes and pay other people to fill them
  up).
