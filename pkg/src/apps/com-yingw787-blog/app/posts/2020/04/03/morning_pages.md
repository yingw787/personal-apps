Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

I found this uber-cute baby video that I just had to share:

    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
</video>

On the plus side, now I get to embed HTML5 video into my blog (instead of
relying on YouTube)! I don't think this should present too much difference in
storage costs, given how I'm cutting and pasting gifs from Reddit. So I get to
download Reddit videos and paste the ones I like here! It's like my own little
personal Instagram.

Also it's Friday, TGIF!

Today I feel strangely calm. I've been sick for the past four weeks or so, and
yesterday was particularly bad. I moved my bed so that I can prop myself up
against the wall and type on my lap while in bed, but I don't think that's a
productive arrangement (laptop keeps slipping and I have to crane my neck in
order to see the screen and I need to increase screen brightness), so I ended up
moving my laptop back to my office area and just setting my standing desk to
high and doing pushups when I need to get some exercise.

I'm still a bit worried about the amount of exercise I've been getting. I'm not
getting enough. It's hard to exercise really if you're sick, and I think I've
been sick since the first week of March or so. I have a really hard time getting
better after I'm sick and so where I am wheezing three or four weeks later. I'm
pretty pissed off because I can think of better uses of my time than
recuperating at home, but I can't do them because it'll exacerbate the sickness.
So recuperation it is.

I'm also worried about my software project. I need to keep working on some
aspects of it to prevent them from going dark, but it's hard to do so while I'm
spending my time learning about DevOps the entire day. I'm not sure whether I'll
be able to just *stop reading the book* and *just learn the material I need to
start*, because I fear I'll lose my ability to read books cover to cover (which
in my mind also translates to shipping a software project end to end). Maybe
it's OCD, maybe it's ADHD, maybe it's just me being crazy, but I've had bad
experiences where I read three books and never finished any of them and resulted
in a depressive state due to impostor syndrome. We'll see what happens today.

Not locking my phone up is a big mistake. I spent 8 hours and 30 minutes on my
phone yesterday, which means I've spent more time on my phone this week than
last week.

I should have purchased the 64GB of RAM a month ago, before all this happened
and before Amazon delayed the shipment in favor of (gasp!) life-saving medical
supplies and grocery essentials. I don't fault them at all, it's absolutely the
right thing to do. It's just annoying, and I'm afraid of further delays as
workers get sick and have to work slower due to taking extra precautions.
Totally understand on that last point too, my decontamination procedures are
around 4-5x slower than normally unpacking my groceries.

Just checked the price for 64GB laptop RAM kits. Amazon is $131, Newegg is $270
minimum. Yeah I'll stop complaining :sweat_smile:
