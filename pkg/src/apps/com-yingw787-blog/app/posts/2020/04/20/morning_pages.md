Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

I don't think I can add a picture of a baby burrito, without adding a picture of
a purrito. It'd just be unfair.

And a pupperito, can't forget about the doggos:

And I don't think I can hold this off until tomorrow because it's too cute,
here's some birdies shaking their booties:

They're not actually shaking their booties, they're simulating rain so that
earthworms can pop out of the ground, so they can eat. But you gotta admit, they
have style.

This weekend was alright. I watched "The Office" until about the middle of
Season 2, and it's been great so far. Also got a good deal of writing hours in
on Saturday, which I found surprising. Usually I just potato my way through life
on the weekends, kind of like I did on Sunday. Just sit on my bed watching
Reddit. It's pretty unhealthy.

You know what I should do with my time? I should look into baking bread. I have
a whole bunch of white, all-purpose flour, and some white sugar, and (I guess)
some salt lying around and I haven't really done anything with them for
about...three or four years...and if now isn't the time to use up those
ingredients they'll never get used up. I think a bunch of other millenials are
making bread and posting them to Instagram, and I want in on that game. It would
mean making a run to the grocery store, because it doesn't make sense to have a
Costco-size shipment of yeast and butter, so I want to make sure I can grab all
that I can carry before that happens. I have no idea what the grocery store
looks like these days, and I'm honestly a bit terrified of entering a grocery
store (or any confined space with other people) at this time. So this might or
might not happen.
