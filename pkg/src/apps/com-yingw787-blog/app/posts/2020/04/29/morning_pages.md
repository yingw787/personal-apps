I think the hardest thing about working on my software project is how little
progress I've shown for the past three months. A quarter of a year!! And I have
a few VPCs and subnets to show for it! It's pretty crazy. Just how I started off

to say. Maybe this [fisherman's
prayer](https://www.beliefnet.com/prayers/catholic/protection/breton-fishermans-prayer.aspx)
suffices:

> Dear God, be good to me; The sea is so wide, And my boat is so small.
