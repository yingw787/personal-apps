Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Look! It's a baby burrito!! This video is quite famous on the Internet for being
one of the cutest baby videos _ever_:

It's been one month since we started morning pages! So happy I have this group.
And it's the first time in a long time that I made it to the morning session!
:tada:

Really happy yesterday that I got published in a official content network
yesterday! I think that's a pretty big deal, when somebody thinks you should get
paid for writing, and then you actually ship a piece they like. I'd like to
write more, I think it might be healthy.

I also watched "The Office" (US) for the first time yesterday. All of Season 1
in one massive evening binge. _It's so good_, I was rolling around on my bed
laughing. I didn't realize just how much I needed to laugh. I might go on a
marathon binge of "The Office" this weekend in order to properly relax
(something I've been trying to work on and failing to do so).

Speaking of this weekend, I think I'll try to work on some "side projects" (or
really, side of side projects) on the weekends. I think it'll be good to learn
Vagrant, or otherwise figure out how to define a GUI layout through a
data-defined VM. Need that for my map thing.
