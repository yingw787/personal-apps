Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Look! Baby chickens come with cupcake skirts!

The weather these last few days has been quite wonderful. I think we're well
into spring at this point. I think I can hear a number of different birds
chirping, and there's these really nice purple flowers that grow directly on
trees. I don't know if I just didn't pay attention to all this when I was living
here, but the nature really is something else.

I think I've found myself checking the COVID-19 ArcGIS dashboard more than
before. I'm in disbelief that the confirmed numbers are increasing *linearly*.
To me, that just indicates how we simply don't have enough tests. I do wish we
had a way in order to track total deaths, and compare that to the previous year,
for a possibly more accurate number. The more it increases linearly, the more
inaccurate the numbers become, and the more uncertainty I feel.

I've been unhappy with my progress on my project, but yesterday I learned a
great deal from reading that book. I need to apply my knowledge to my existing
project before I forget things. I also don't have a healthy relationship with
relaxation, and I mentioned it for the first time to my "boss", who replied back
that we can try timeboxing relaxation too. I think that will help things a great
deal.

The days kind of blend together at this point. Others have mentioned it too,
with both working from home and having kids at home instead of at work, you lose
track of which day it is. I'm not sure whether U.S. companies get Good Friday or
Easter Monday off. Frankly I don't care, I don't think I'll be celebrating
Easter by meeting up with people or buying Easter eggs from the grocery store or
anything. Might crack open my Bible though.
