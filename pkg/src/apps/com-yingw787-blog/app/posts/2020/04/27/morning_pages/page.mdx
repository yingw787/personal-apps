Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.

Today I feel...tepid, and worried (no difference there). I do wonder whether
there's an end to this apprehension. It's like taking a leap of faith, and
having to believe that things will turn out all right. It's so friggin' hard.
I'm not even sure it's possible. Sigh. Nothing to it, I guess. Just have to keep
marching.
