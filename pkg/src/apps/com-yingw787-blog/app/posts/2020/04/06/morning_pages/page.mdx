Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Ah, to be as carefree as this baby again:

That would be nice.

I think today would be the second quarter of this year, and I should be thinking
of a new topic to write about for my writer's group. I have one thing I want to
get off my chest, and I think I'll just write about it so as to forget about it
and move on with my life. I think it will be healthy.

I think this weekend's been much better than previous weekends. I was able to
get up and about and do some tasks. Hope this week will be better, especially
now that I'm planning in periods of relaxation instead of just expecting myself
to fail and then keep going along that path.

Yeah, not a whole lot to say today. Let's make today worth remembering.
