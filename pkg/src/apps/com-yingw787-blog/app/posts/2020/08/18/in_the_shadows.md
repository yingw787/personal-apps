I think I might have mentioned this before somewhere, but I have an addiction to
Internet pornography. I think I developed it during college when I did a
psychological research study on vital signs while watching software pornography
for $20. I thought it would be fine. Nope. Worst $20 I've ever earned.

A few months ago, I breached this subject to my therapist, who mentioned this
book as a way in order to learn more about coping and recovery mechanisms
specific to Internet cybersex addiction.

I think the really interesting things about this book is how they detail what
relapse looks like and the fallacies behind each rationalization. It also
mentions some amount of forms and plans you can construct yourself in order to
address this topic effectively (such as an Internet health plan), and different
approaches and attitudes towards addiction topics.

Psychology books are interesting because even though (in my opinion, which may
be flawed) it's a "soft" science without too much quantitative evidence (mostly
just links), assertions have the ability to maintain over time without being
invalidated, and they can build on top of each other. The book predicted the
commoditization of sex twenty years before the rise of hookup culture, and the
deleterious effects of commoditizing something so primal and ingrained. I think
this is a book I'll have to come back to.
