Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

It's my birthday today! :tada: To celebrate, here's a cute picture _and_ a cute
video!

Here's a really cute kitten:

And a little boy reading to a cat:

I think the protests have popped back up, heard [somebody murdered somebody else
with police
consent](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-kenosha-wisconsin-protesters-shot-jacob-blake-20200826-2whqqtogjrcx5db5zfdkuw374y-story.html).
In other news, [the CDC has limited testing for asymptomatic people even if they
have been in contact with COVID infected
patients](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/26/cdc-quietly-revises-coronavirus-guidance-to-downplay-importance-of-testing-for-asymptomatic-people.html),
maybe because [Dr. Fauci was undergoing surgery during the
meeting](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/fauci-says-he-was-under-anesthesia-when-cdc-changed-covid-19-testing-guidelines/ar-BB18p0Wp).
I don't say this to be a drama queen, but I think the news is starting to get to
me. Last night I dreamt I was being chased by a mob in a burning city while the
police stood by and I forgot to wear my mask. Maybe I should keep a news diet,
this isn't healthy.

Sooooo birthday! I purchased myself a 2TB NVMe SSD drive online in order to
bolster by existing 256GB drive, and I think my mom is making me steak for lunch
(my mom makes some pretty bomb steaks). I might also walk around the
neighborhood if the weather's good. I think overall, today will be a pretty good
day.
