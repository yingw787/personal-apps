Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

I finished watching Season 4 of "Parks and Rec" yesterday! I actually had this
coding assignment for an interview application, and I finished it early because
I was so tired I was making elementary mistakes, but also because I wanted to
watch "Parks and Rec". It's very 4th grade of me to finish things too quickly so
that I can go watch TV, but it's also nice to have something to look forward to
after work, and that's not a feeling I've had for some time now.

I also managed to sleep pretty much right after I went to bed, which is kind of
a miracle (usually it takes around an hour or so, today it took 15 minutes).
Calm Sleep Stories really help out here. I also woke up naturally in the first
time in a few months, instead of being woken up by my alarm clock (because I
slept early). Good things build on each other and hopefully I can build on this
one day's worth of momentum.

Life isn't perfect, but I think it has gotten better for me in the past few
months. Back in June, I was pretty much starving because my sabbatical funds
were running out quicker than I thought they were, and not capable of doing any
work because I was so hungry. Maybe that's being overly dramatic. But today, I'm
living (at my parent's place) in a pretty nice neighborhood, going outside for
walks, waving to neighbors, getting paid (really well IMHO) for a job that I
like, and having no health problems really during a global pandemic. It's crazy
to think about.

I'm sure there will be ups and downs as the situation develops, and things
aren't perfect (e.g. I wish I had an S/O I cared about or something, I don't
really talk to my little brother, etc.), but I think it's really good overall,
and a lot better than things were just a few short months ago.
