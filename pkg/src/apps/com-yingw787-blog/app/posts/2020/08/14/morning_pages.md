Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

Hello there.

I think I'm living in a Kafkaesque bubble. Everything in front of me says things
are great. I have a great job, I think this week has been a long streak of great
weather, good food, quality sleep, friends available a click away, all that good
stuff. But you wouldn't figure it out by looking at the news, or reading a
discussion forum, or just talking with somebody one on one. Maybe things are
really bad actually and I don't know it, or maybe the news has always been
extremely shrill about things in order to get more ratings. And what is *up*
with all the Trump signs on my neighbor's lawns? I haven't seen a single Biden
sign anywhere, and there's like 4-5 neighbors who've already put up Trump signs
(though to be fair, Trump did start his re-election bid on his inauguration
day).

It's just...rather surreal, is all. I don't even know if mail forwarding is
going on properly, especially with [the changes in
USPS](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24135668), so I have no idea whether
I'm supposed to get my mail at my parent's house or my mailbox in Virginia is
overflowing or it's overflowing at some USPS facility or just being tossed into
the trash because apparently they're treating some first-class mail like bulk
mail.

Maybe I should read some books by Franz Kafka.
