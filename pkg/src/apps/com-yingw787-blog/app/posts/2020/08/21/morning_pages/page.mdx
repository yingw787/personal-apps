Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

I finished binge watching "Parks and Rec" yesterday (or really this morning)! I
have to say, I'm really digging binge watching TV shows, I never knew it could
be this fun. Or really maybe I could, because the average American watches
something like five hours of television...? The problem is that now I can't
watch these shows for the first time again...! Which really sucks, because I'm
always just a little terrified that the next TV show I watch will suck,
especially at the end. "Parks and Rec" is great (and I'll probably have a TV
show review posted by end of this weekend), but I don't think the cult following
is as big as say "The Office". I wonder if there are other Office-like
mockmentaries, I think that's kind of my sweet spot. Seems like a healthy
addiction if there ever was one.

Otherwise I guess I can read through the Scala and formal reasoning books I have
at a quicker pace, probably need to do so anyways for work and stuff.

Speaking of TV shows (and today's topic of speechwriting w.r.t. the DNC speech),
there was this one TV miniseries recorded in the 1980s about what a bloodless
coup of the U.S. by the Soviet Union would look like. It's called
["Amerika"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerika_(miniseries)>) and I do say it
looks freakishly realistic given how reality has played out. Some nice snippets
include Congress getting massacred, the country broken up into different
occupational zones, and the abandoning of American ideals by the citizenry
leading to those who wish to restore the United States being called "libtards"
and such. Because that's totally not the future.

This is why I prefer to stick to "The Office" and "Parks and Rec" and such,
happy positive TV shows because then I'd have something healthy to look forward
to. Maybe some guys would want to be Andy, or Ben, I think I'd like to be Gary
Gergich and live in a pastel-colored house eating bacon and eggs every morning
and having a hug train with a wife and daughters before going to work and be
positive and upbeat no matter what the world throws at me. That sounds pretty
awful nice right about now.
