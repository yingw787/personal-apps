Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

I wish there was a party parrot like the one in Slack, but I don't think the
GitHub flavored Markdown supports it, so here's a parrot:

and a *true* party parrot:

I'm not quite sure what TV show I'll watch next, or when I'll start watching it,
or whether I really want to keep watching TV. I think when I asked for
recommendations for shows, he brought up Brooklyn Nine-Nine, 30 Rock, and Veep.
That's a lot of airtime, airtime that I might spend better going outside or
reading books or doing other stuff. I do think it's a good fallback in case I
get sucked down a YouTube binge though. A TV show binge is finite; a YouTube
binge is eternal. It's nice to know that I'm not *too* attached to any one TV
show, and that I enjoy watching it and that it's something I'm learned to look
forward to at the end of the day. Now that I have that in my back pocket, I
should probably look for other things to do with my time. Like stretching, I
don't think I've stretched for a few months, it's pretty crazy.

I'm looking at this bank of 100 AAA batteries that I purchased. I originally
thought that there would be no way I could avoid using up my batteries for my
headphones, then I discovered the volume dial on my cable and that was that. So
I'm not sure what to do with these batteries. I have hundreds of them unused in
my apartment back in Virginia, so I might as well bring it back with me when the
time's right.

Nice thing about this purchase is the NVMe mounting screw set I purchased in
order to get free shipping. I'm running out of disk space on my laptop due to
the amount of `node_modules/` I need to install, and I purchased a second, 2TB
NVMe drive in order to complement my existing 256GB NVMe drive. Hopefully it's
not too difficult to attach a second drive.
