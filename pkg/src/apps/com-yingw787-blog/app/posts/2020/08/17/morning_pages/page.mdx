Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

I sleep again now fren.

Another week has started! I have no idea where this weekend went, but I do know
I finished binging "Parks and Rec" Season 5! I think I'm starting to dream about
"Parks and Rec" characters now, just like I dreamed about "The Office"
characters a few weeks ago when I was binging that show. I think I'm slowly
starting to accept that weekends are downtime for me, even if that's been true
for the past few months. I think overall, that's a good thing, and a good way to
mark the days between work and life.
