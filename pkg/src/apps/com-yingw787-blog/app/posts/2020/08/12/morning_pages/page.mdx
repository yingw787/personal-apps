Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

I didn't realize some people were using quarantine to become Disney princesses,
but apparently they are:

I don't think I've mentioned my dad's gardening habit on my blog before, and I
think it might be an interesting topic of discussion. I think so far my dad
grows cucumbers, wintermelon, green onion, water spinach, and ["tan
hua"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphyllum_oxypetalum). Yes, apparently you
can eat "tan hua", so after they bloom you can cut the flowers off and boil them
to make broth. Apparently it's a herbal remedy for the lungs, which might be
nice in a worldwide pandemic that attacks the lungs (though I've heard COVID-19
isn't a respiratory disease but a cardiovascular one that manifests in the
lungs).

I've had the benefit of seeing maybe 50 "tan hua" blossom during my time back at
my parent's place. I think my dad at least has video, but my phone is locked up
and he's working. So here's a picture w/ proof:

It's a lot of "tan hua". And this is one harvest, there were two since I came
back home, and I think my dad said there are maybe three or four harvests a
year. So that's nice. "tan hua" soup is thick but not flavorful, you can kind of
taste the flowers but not really. It's a weird sensation to eat. Not sure how to
describe it, I think somebody with a sharper palate and who cares more can
probably describe it better than I do.

Also TIL that cucumbers grow so fast you can harvest them every day. It kind of
makes sense, it's mostly water. My dad has this farming thing on our deck with a
bunch of these massive potted cucumber plants, and we harvest 1-3 of them for
lunch every day. They're small, and curly and knobbly and I think they might
have hairs on them that my mom washes off and I'm not sure whether fertilizer
makes a difference to the nutrition, but they're not bad and I'm not dead yet,
so I guess it's cool.

My dad also fishes a great deal, he used to catch a bunch of fish early on in my
stay, but now that the water's warmer the fish don't like going near the edges
of the lake (probably because they don't want to suffocate and because there's
more food in the middle of the lake for some reason now).

I kind of want a ranch where I can raise chickens and grow my own potatoes and
stuff. It's nice not having to worry about food security now, and it'll be even
better not having to worry about food security in the coming years. I think you
only need maybe like 2-3 productive acres in order to raise a family. I might
want a bit more land so I can go hunting wild boar and stuff, like a European
king :)
