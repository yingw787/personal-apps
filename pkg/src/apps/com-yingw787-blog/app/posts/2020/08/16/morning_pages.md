Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

I spent part of yesterday thinking about how much I like the toilet in my
parent's basement bathroom. My apartment in Arlington was built (I think) in the
1940s, when people were smaller and thinner because there wasn't as much food or
something, so the toilets are made for normal-sized people. Plus-sized people
weren't a thing. Now obesity is everywhere, and that means things are designed
to multiple times their original size and durability. I think the basement
bathroom toilet is designed for an extremely fat person, which is why it's so
big and nice to sit on. Maybe not as much lemonade as I would like out of this
lemon, but what can you do. Maybe not talk about it, maybe that's it.

It's strangely dark today. Usually it's super bright, but I think since it's
raining, the thunderstorm covered the sun and made it seem like it's a few hours
earlier in the day. Either that, or the days are just getting shorter as we get
closer to winter. That reminds me of how much I like Michigan weather. I keep
getting these reports of flash floods and heat waves and tropical storms and
whatnot in Arlington, and here in Michigan it doesn't seem like those are
things. Maybe they would be if I had signed up for county updates.

One coworker I talked to last Thursday had traveled pretty much everywhere,
including everywhere in Michigan, and mentioned how cheap land prices were in
upper Michigan (either Upper Peninsula or the northern part of the Lower
Peninsula). For something like $300,000, you can purchase a hundred acres of
land with some small cabin on the shorelines of Lake Superior. That sounds
rather dreamy. I think I should only purchase things I could defend...which
makes me question whether I should purchase a house in the city. Purchasing land
in northern Michigan and maybe some land in northern Ontario would be really
cool. Or live in Kingston, ON. That'd be nice.
