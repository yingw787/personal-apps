Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

So today's prompt (which I woke up in time to hear) is how have my social skills
changed during the 140+ days of quarantine. One peep went on a trip of some sort
for 5 days with a group of 8 people (all COVID tested beforehand), and
apparently there's some loss of social finesse. I think for me there has to be
some social finesse to lose in the first place before I can actually say whether
the pandemic has changed things (lol), but in truth I think I've become a good
deal quieter this year. I've kind of gotten used to silence over multiple days
and not really talking to people. The lack of a strong, in-person social network
means I go days without talking to people. Family isn't very talkative either,
so I end up just not talking. The nice thing is, I do talk to my fellow
coworkers during the days I'm at work, so I should still be able to
self-maintain over time.

Kind of crazy how the pandemic might last years if we vote for Trump again (a
very real possibility, I personally fixed his chances at 90% for re-election),
so the ability to self-maintain is really important.
