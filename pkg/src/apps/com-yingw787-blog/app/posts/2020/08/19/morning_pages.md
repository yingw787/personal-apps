Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

Now who doesn't like a golden retriever?

I think the summer fever has broken. Today has been much more chilly than I
remember just last week being. I need to wear actual pants and a jacket if I'm
going to be comfy working next to the window.

I'm thinking about my coworker's mention of purchasing land up north in
Michigan, and renting a small condo near the city, as a nice permanent
arrangement. Why I'm thinking that now I don't know, because I don't have enough
money in order to make that arrangement work out, but it sounds like a viable
and maybe even desirable arrangement as cities warm up and you have to keep
moving ever north or ever south. I'm just thinking about what life will be like
if say, northern Michigan ever became as hot as Georgia does.

I don't think I have the ability to dream positively about the world today. The
nice thing is that dreams don't matter, work does, and as long as you work
towards a better future, it's likely to happen.

On the subject of working hard, I spent yesterday binging Season 6 of "Parks and
Rec". So good I can't put it down. Only one more season to go!
