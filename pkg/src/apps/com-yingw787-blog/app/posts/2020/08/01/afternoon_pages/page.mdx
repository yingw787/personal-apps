Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

This is fine.

Apparently it's supposed to rain for three days here. I don't check the weather
usually, and most of the time back in Virginia I carry an umbrella, so usually
it's not a big deal. But I'm not in Virginia, I'm in Michigan.

I'm planning on heading back to Virginia around end of September. Not quite sure
what things will look like then, but at that point it should be a good change
from living back at my parent's place.

I'm not sure if I've mentioned my job here yet, but so far it's not bad! I like
my coworkers, the work seems nice, and it's a promising vertical. I just have to
focus on doing a good job. I'm continuing to explore other opportunities, but
they haven't panned out the way I had hoped. Most companies are still ghosting
me, probably because I don't have FAANG or FAANG+ on my resume, and it might
have something to do with the recession (though they mentioned that they were
all hiring, and tech really isn't impacted all that much from the recession).

What I'm frustrated about is the slow pace of my own personal work. I get that
it's slow because it's hard ramming your head against a wall over and over again
by yourself. I just have to keep at it and hope things will turn out fine. It's
just ever more important that I build up my own independent income stream,
because nobody will be there for me when the going gets tough (I think right
now, we're still in the tutorial level).
