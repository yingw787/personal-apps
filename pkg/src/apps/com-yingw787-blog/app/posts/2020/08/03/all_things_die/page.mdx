I recently came across [a Reddit post about certain Star Wars
quotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/MawInstallation/comments/78yn10/post_a_quote_from_revenge_of_the_sith_and_ill/).
I particularly resonated with this one:

> Children on Tatooine tell each other of the dragons that live inside the suns;
> smaller cousins of the sun-dragons are supposed to live inside the fusion
> furnaces that power everything from starships to Podracers.
>
> But Anakin's fear is another kind of dragon. A cold kind. A dead kind.
>
> Not nearly dead enough.
>
> Not long after he became Obi-Wan's Padawan, all those years ago, a minor
> mission had brought them to a dead system: one so immeasurably old that its
> star had long ago turned to a frigid dwarf of hypercompacted trace metals,
> hovering a quantum fraction of a degree above absolute zero. Anakin couldn't
> even remember what the mission might have been, but he'd never forgotten that
> dead star.
>
> It had scared him.
>
> "Stars can die—?"
>
> "It is the way of the universe, which is another manner of saying that it is
> the will of the Force," Obi-Wan had told him. "Everything dies. In time, even
> stars burn out. This is why Jedi form no attachments: all things pass. To hold
> on to something— or someone—beyond its time is to set your selfish desires
> against the Force. That is a path of misery, Anakin; the Jedi do not walk it."
>
> That is the kind of fear that lives inside Anakin Skywalker: the dragon of
> that dead star. It is an ancient, cold dead voice within his heart that
> whispers all things die…
>
> At night, the dead-star dragon sometimes sneaks through the cracks and crawls
> up into his brain and chews at the inside of his skull. The dragon whispers of
> what Anakin has lost. And what he will lose.
>
> The dragon reminds him, every night, of how he held his dying mother in his

>
> The dragon reminds him, every night, that someday he will lose Obi-Wan. He

>
> All things die, Anakin Skywalker. Even stars burn out…
>
> ...he's already the best, and he's still getting better. But locked away

I'd say I think about death more frequently than my peers. Not everybody posts
["The Five Regrets of the Dying"](/five_regrets) on their personal blog. I think
ruminating about death constantly isn't curse, but rather a blessing. People in
Bhutan [think about death five times a
day](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20150408-bhutans-dark-secret-to-happiness),
and they're reportedly one of the happier countries in the world. Investing in
things that don't change as a life philosophy subtly acknowledges that death
lies at the end of all paths: all people, all life, all Creation. It is in some
ways a final truth, and to deny the truth is to deny we who live in it.

I recall going to a salsa dancing meetup in D.C. a few years back, when I talked
to a man who said he wanted to live forever. When he asked whether I wanted to
live forever, he was surprised when I said no. I thought then, and I still think
now, people are born into a time. Ultimately that time passes, while we remain
inherently stuck in the past, and it's good to move on. My world is still
somewhat reminiscent of the 90s: seeing boxy trucks drive around, walking to the
airport gate to see off my grandparents, and eating Breyers ice cream with
enjoyment, three things that just don't happen anymore.

No, literally, Breyers had to rename their ice cream to "frozen dessert" because
it doesn't contain enough cream to be called "ice cream".

I think this is a problem, because a refusal to accept death as natural is what
gives rise to some of our deepest anxieties. The anti-maskers and anti-vaxxers
walking around right now probably know what the right solution is. They just
don't want to believe it. Then on the other end of the spectrum, you have
[billionaires transfusing blood from teenagers to stay
young](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/08/peter-thiel-wants-to-inject-himself-with-young-peoples-blood).
It's not an intelligence issue, or even an empathy issue. It's a matter of
perspective.

If I had to explain to a five-year old who told me (s)he was afraid to die, I'd
reply that life is a lot like a birthday cake. You don't try to save all of it
forever, because you can't, it gets hard or moldy and you lose it anyways.
Instead, you enjoy one small slice of it at a time. If you're having a birthday
party, you can share slices of it with your friends and family. Eating a
birthday cake comes naturally. So does death.

It is nice to extend life to avoid getting mauled by a wild bear, or trapping
oneself in a steam engine, or catching COVID. But we shouldn't forget that we
shouldn't prevent the inevitable. All things die, even stars burn out. The thing
that brings me comfort is how things aren't beautiful because they last, they're
beautiful because it makes life worth living.
