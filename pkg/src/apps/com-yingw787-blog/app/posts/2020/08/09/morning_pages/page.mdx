Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

Behold! The infamous cross-dog:

So last night I had a dream where somehow I lived in the future and I got four
freeze-dried white kittens. Then I poured some water on top of them and then
they got up and started walking around and then I started petting them. It was
really cute, most of my dreams aren't as nice. Then my alarm clock woke me up.

That'd be really cool, innit? I'd like to own a cat or something but I'm a
little scared I wouldn't be competent enough to take care of it, and then it'd
die and then I wouldn't feel anything. Not sure if I have ever mentioned my
basil plant, but the most successful basil I've grown is in my fridge when I
left it over accidentally. When I purchased a live basil plant and a planter, it
died. Maybe I should get a cat accidentally, like foster a kitten or something.

I don't know if it'd be that hard. There are some number of stray cats walking
around in my neighborhood, and they seem friendly enough. This one time I was
walking to work, and this cat came up in front of me and lied down tummy up. I,
not taking a clue, walked around the cat, who then leapt up and lied down in
front of me again with its tummy up. I, being hopeless, continued walking and
the cat realized I'm not going to rub its belly.

Then again, I'm also remembering the time when I walked some shelter dogs. They
were...interesting...and I don't think I'd do it again. Maybe my mind is trying
to tell me something and I'm ignoring it because I'm too thick. Or maybe it's
just a dream.
