Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

The famous catdog goes for a walk!

Maybe it should be the kittendog :)

I bit the bullet recently and purchased two different books on formal reasoning,
"Practical TLA+" by Hillel Wayne (covering TLA+), and "Software Abstractions" by
Daniel Jackson (which covers Alloy). I guess it's kind of weird to purchase
these books since I don't have too much background and little interest in
pursuing formal methods / formal reasoning professionally full-time. But I keep
thinking about my database-backed spreadsheet for QA teams idea, and I keep
thinking about the "rules engine" or formal model I'd be checking into the
program as part of working on that idea, and I think investing in the future
helps me believe I have one.

I think this pandemic turned me into a T.V. aficionado. This is one thing I
didn't expect from the pandemic. I think it's a healthy thing overall, because
it is a form of relaxation, and it does give me some chuckles I otherwise
wouldn't have gotten, but man I've been binging pretty hard. I'm not sure
whether to be mad at myself for not being productive during evenings + weekends,
or happy that I'm not being productive during evenings + weekends. I am pretty
happy that given my newfound T.V. addiction, I stick to mockumentary office
comedies.

(By the way I love Rashida Jones!! Ann Perkins AND Karen Filippelli!! I kind of
get celebrity worship now...which is probably not a good thing, but I think
comes with the territory.)
