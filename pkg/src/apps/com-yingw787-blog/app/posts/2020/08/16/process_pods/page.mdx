This is my first "Process Pods" session, where we gather to reflect on the
"challenging, messy, and rewarding parts of the writing process". This session
is focused around getting thoughts onto the page.

What do I want to get out of today from "Process Pods"?

- It'd be cool to improve on some of the writing I do for Morning Poppins.
  Usually it's random ramblings.

  Erik: Morning Poppins is usually for clearing my head, getting clutter for
  writing something I'm more serious about wouldn't worry too much about it,
  also I'm usually awake before Morning Poppins and writing @ 6:30AM.

  Jessie: maybe you should have a concrete goal for Morning Poppins? Me: Yeah I
  thought that if I was to publish my writings as one cohesive thing I would
  want to process a bunch of raw writings than a bunch of highly edited posts,
  in order to preserve the context and authenticity and etc.

- It'd be nice to do some freehand handwriting. I type a lot and I think my
  handwriting is pretty atrocious, and I would like to send a care package to a
  friend in France.

- Defining an audience for your writing?

  Erik: I try not to think about it...

  As you write more stuff on a consistent basis, you'll find people you like
  what you're going to say.
