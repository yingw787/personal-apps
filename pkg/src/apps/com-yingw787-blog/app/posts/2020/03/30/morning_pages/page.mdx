Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of partial lockdown. To alleviate fear and
stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together
on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief
thoughts.

A blue birdy!

I think I had my first COVID-19 related dream last night, I forgot what it was.
Also looks like my age-old fear, that of going hungry, might actually become a
reality, with people walking off the fields and the factories. I'm not exactly
sure how to guarantee a fresh supply of veggies though. If push comes to shove,
it might be a good idea to go home, because home has a backyard and a basement
with some ability to grow food.

Good things to talk about, let's see. It's pretty sunny this morning! Might go
out for a longer walk. Also video chatted with a friend for a few hours
yesterday and got to reconnect there, and I think we're gonna try and do a study
buddy thing where we can work on our own stuff and remain accountable. I think
that'll be good for both of us.

I think he asked when the last time I saw somebody in person was, and I'd say
beginning of March. That's pretty crazy to think about. This cough won't go away
and I got it then and was self-quarantining just in case, and it still won't go
away. So no people and no in-person contact.

Oh yes, he also mentioned how my darker thoughts could be positively expressed
if I just write a book about them. I think that could be a healthy goal for Q2
Finisher's Group, finish a novel. We'll see how that balances out with the need
to work on software projects and for my skills to not atrophy. What's really
important for me during this time of uncertainty is to get the devops shit done,
out the door, so that I can continue to work on my Python and JavaScript skills
for this project, so that I can table the project and go back to Haskell and
what not.

Lots of work to be done this week, so hopefully today is a new day and I can
power through the pile!
