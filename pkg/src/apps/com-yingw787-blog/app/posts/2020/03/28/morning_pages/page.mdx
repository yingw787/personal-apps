Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of partial lockdown. To alleviate fear and
stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together
on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief
thoughts.

I think in addition to [r/aww](https://reddit.com/r/aww), there's also
[r/oddlysatisfying](https://www.reddit.com/r/oddlysatisfying/), which is oddly
but also extremely satisfying. Like, look at this picture of a perfect lemon:

Have you seen anything as perfect in your whole life? Of course you have, I've
been posting pictures of baby animals all week.

Now onto the hard stuff. Don't read if you've already had a bad day.

Okay?

<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />

Okay.

So I read the rather distressing news today that [President Donald Trump is
withholding medical supplies from Michigan because the governor is a female
Democrat](https://wwjnewsradio.radio.com/articles/after-trump-attacks-whitmer-she-says-fed-supplies-delayed):

> After President Donald Trump issued scathing comments about Michigan Gov.
> Gretchen Whitmer, saying she's "not stepping up," and "doesn't know what's
> going on," she told WWJ 950 the state is having trouble getting the equipment
> they need to fight the novel coronavirus.
>
> "What I've gotten back is that vendors with whom we've procured contracts --
> They're being told not to send stuff to Michigan," Whitmer said live on air.
> "It's really concerning, I reached out to the White House last night and asked
> for a phone call with the president, ironically at the time this stuff was
> going on."

Here's another angle around how President Trump is telling Vice President Pence
to [not call governors who aren't 'grateful' enough for his
efforts](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2020/03/27/coronavirus-donald-trump-tells-pence-not-call-michigan-governor/2931251001/):

> President Donald Trump said Friday he has asked Vice President Mike Pence not

>
> That governor – Gretchen Whitmer – replied on Twitter that "right now, we all

>
> "I’m willing to work with anyone as long as we get the personal protective

Here's this story that broke today, people hoped that Democratic congressmen
were going to negotiate controls and transparency on corporate bailouts.
President Trump signed the bill and _immediately afterwards_ [declared he will
not follow those same transparency measures he
signed](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/28/21197995/coronavirus-stimulus-trump-inspector-general-wont-comply),

Nobody alive has dealt with anything like this. People are picking examples from
the 1918 Spanish Flu, and to 1861-1865 Civil War. I think this situation does
set a new precedent in U.S. history.

**_This is nothing compared to what's coming._** What I'm writing here is
something I've been thinking about for years, and too afraid to publicly admit
because I think it'd be too dark and scary for others and because it'd
negatively affect my life with little benefit. But now I'm writing it to make
sure I think things through.

We're now very much in a "cold civil war" between at least two political parties
and at least two geographic regions of the country. More distrubingly, the past
month presents the confluence of multiple Black Swan events (Donald Trump's
election as the 45th President, and COVID-19 being the respiratory influenza
with human-to-human contact, asympotatic transmission, and 1% mortality rate)
being chained together and influencing each other.

That's kind of what we've been seeing over the past 30 or so years, ever since
the end of the Cold War and the globalization of trade and the monetization of
the peace dividend. This was planned, and expected, by many people, politicians
and voters alike.

Something only a few (maybe prescient) people realized at the time is benefits
of this peace dividend will go to certain sectors of the population more than
others, certain states more than others, certain value structures more than
others. Keep the old ways, and lose out. Keep the only constant as change, and
swim in gold coins like Scrooge McDuck.

The "greatest generation" of politicians and voters began dying off, and things
like money and power became society's common denominator. It's transparent,
reliable and trusted among good and bad alike, and quite immutable (not in
inflation-adjusted terms). Peace weakens, and society became brittle. Things
like manufacturing surge capacity and emergency management became operational
overhead to be cut and streamlined. Peace also corrupts, because humans are
falliable. Income inequality isn't just because some people work harder than
others, it's also because after some point, you get to write the rules of the
game:

Now enter the first Black Swan event, Donald Trump's election. January 20th,
2017, and still ongoing today. One thing interesting about this president is how
constant approval and disapproval numbers are. This is a snapshot of
[FiveThiryEight's poll
numbers](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings/). I trust
Nate Silver and FiveThirtyEight more than other poll aggregators because they
warned of this black swan back in 2015-2016 when giving the lowest chances of
Hillary Clinton winning the 2016 presidential election.

(Sanitizing `$FAMOUS_GERMAN_LEADER` and `$FAMOUS_IDEOLOGY` to appear lower in
SEO results and hopefully avoid being brigaded and doxxed by neo-Nazis with too
much time on their hands)

People compare Trump to `$FAMOUS_GERMAN_LEADER` all the time (like they compare
every president to `$FAMOUS_GERMAN_LEADER` a la [Godwin's
Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin%27s_law)), and so let's be reminded
that `$FAMOUS_GERMAN_LEADER` won around 35% in 1932 to be able to enact
emergency powers and end the Weimar Republic. What people may _not_ realize is
how in 1946, after Germany looked like this:

[dresden 1945](/img/posts/2020/03/28/morning_pages_4.jpeg)

A shockingly high proportion of Germans supported `$FAMOUS_GERMAN_LEADER` and
$FAMOUS_IDEOLOGY. This is of course an extremely touchy topic, so I went ahead
and looked for polls, and sure enough, here's [a collation of OMGUS surveys run
in the American Occupied Zone in
Germany](https://ia802606.us.archive.org/25/items/publicopinionino00merr/publicopinionino00merr.pdf),
of which Survey No. 68 stands out (pasted in full below, and on page 171 of the
linked PDF):

> Report No. 68 (10 October 1947)
>
> **TRENDS IN ATTITUDES TOWARD `$FAMOUS_IDEOLOGY`**
>
> _Sample: unspecified number, representing a cross-section of the adults in the
> American Zone and the American and British Sectors of Berlin._
>
> _Interviewing dates: between November 1945 and August 1947. (5 pp.)_
>
> Despite fluctuations, the percentage of Germans describing `$FAMOUS_IDEOLOGY`
> as a good idea badly carried out remained at a fairly high number -- starting
> at 53 per cent in November 1945, dipping to a low of 42 per cent in July 1946,
> and rising again to 55 per cent by August 1947. Those regarding it as a bad
> idea rose from 41 per cent in November 1945 to 48 per cent in July 1946 but
> dropped once more to 35 per cent in August 1947. Another way of describing this
> trend is to say that, in the period from November 1945 to July 1946, the
> average number of people who thought `$FAMOUS_IDEOLOGY` basically a good idea
> was 48 per cent; between December 1946 and August 1947 it was 52 per cent.
>
> In July 1947, opinions on this issue were related to attitudes toward
> democracy, individual liberty as against economic security, and the
> responsibility of Hitler and his advisers for his acts. People who tended to
> excuse `$FAMOUS_IDEOLOGY` were most ready to pick flaws in the working of
> democracy (42%), to choose security (70%) rather than liberty (22%), and to
> throw the blame for Hitler's acts on his advisers (32%) rather than on Hitler
> himself (25%), with another 37 per cent blaming both.
>
> In August 1947, the population groups containing the largest proportions of

And **this is a critical piece of information**, because people naturally think
if bad things start happening to you, to the degree of getting bombed back to
the Stone Age, you'll naturally dislike your leaders and pivot towards the
"right" idea, and **that very much isn't the case** when voting on matters like
identity.

This pandemic will pass. My friends and family in Michigan should be safe,
because Michigan itself has vast natural resources and a solid manufacturing
base (which is partially due to President Obama's bailout of the auto industry
back during the last recession). But now, the possibility of "enemy" agents
hostile to state interests based on majority-based political affiliation, and
having those agents distributed through all three branches of the federal
government, is a very scary proposition. A nation that's been defeated by an
enemy can rise back up, but one that crumbles from within is dead forever.

To be very clear, I'm absolutely not advocating for secessionism. Besides the
fact that secession is a treasonable offence punishable by death, I'm also a
strong federalist and believe in the power of unity over discord. From a laws of
power perspective, having the nuclear weapons supply chain, command authority,
and launch / delivery facilities and vehicles fractured is a very bad thing for
world peace. I don't think we've even found all the [suitcase
nukes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suitcase_nuclear_device) after the collapse
of the Soviet Union. But I think we're going to need to sit down and talk about
this, because events that have physically happened have forced it already, and I
just want to be mentally prepared and to know what I believe in. If something as
unthinkable as the country falling apart happens, I will probably choose to die
here. My life has been a bet on this country succeeding, I don't think I want to
change that, and to be honest I'm not sure if I want to see what happens next.

**There's undeniably a strong argument to be made that the Union no longer makes
sense for some**. I'll give you an example. I became an American citizen in high
school. In college, I had my first real-world experiences meeting and
interacting with people who came directly from other countries. In those bonds,
I found friendship, cameraderie, and many common beliefs.

Now if I ran a thought experiment, and I asked myself, who would I choose to be
my neighbor, my friends from college, or a randomly selected person from
Oklahoma, I might not choose the person from Oklahoma. I'd probably choose my
friend from college. I don't think that's a huge problem. I think the randomly
selected person from Oklahoma would also choose his or her friend from college!
