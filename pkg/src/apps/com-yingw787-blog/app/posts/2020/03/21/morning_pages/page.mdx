Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of partial lockdown. To alleviate fear and
stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together
on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief
thoughts.

---

So many things swirling in my head right now. I went to Trader Joe's for the
first time in a while, and I'm glad I went in the morning, because the line for
the checkout almost snaked out the door. I went running for the first time but
couldn't really find any public spaces that were free of people. I showered
three times yesterday in hopes of reducing the amount of virus I'm exposed to at
home from going out. I also committed to shipping my MVP by March 27th, 2020 @
11:59PM ET. I'm glad I timeboxed it to then, but I feel like it's not a lot of
time. So even though I came late to this morning's Morning Pages session, I'm
glad I came and I'm glad it's here. It's really important for me to have a
constant in my life I don't need to worry about.

This cough isn't going away, and I'm not quite sure what will make it. I just
hope it doesn't turn bacterial right when the healthcare system goes down.

I think I need to laugh more, or see more cute baby, kitten, or puppy pictures.
Do something in order to alleviate the stress. I do think it's getting to me one
way or another. Here's a puppy that ate too much strawberry jam.
