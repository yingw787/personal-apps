Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of partial lockdown. To alleviate fear and
stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together
on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief
thoughts.

Look at these little guys! Aren't they just the cutest?

I think I've found value from this blog just writing drafts and not publishing
them. There isn't a morning pages publication from yesterday because I was going
down a pretty dark path with where I was thinking, but it helps in feeling
relief by just writing something down, even if it isn't complete.

I still haven't gone outside today, and I definitely screwed up something
yesterday. So today, I think I'll stop my relentless focus on "being
productive", and just try to focus on "staying awake". I think that should be an
easier goal.

It would be really cool to feed some geese or something else physically alive at
this point. I think if this quarantine lasts for a longer period of time, I
might want to foster a cat, and maybe a kitten after that. Have my own little
baby fur pillow to keep me company.

One thing that is kind of troubling me is how Screen Time and Night Shift and
accessibility features on my iPhone aren't preserved across system restarts. I
have to manually configure them because the phone apparently forgets, and
there's no way in order to export the full settings configuration as a profile
of some sort. I'll take a second look at that and see whether I can get
anywhere.

My brain is pretty fuzzy at this point, so maybe I will try to wrap up this
post. Here's something I've found quite satisfying:
