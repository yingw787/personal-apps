Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of partial lockdown. To alleviate fear and
stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together
on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief
thoughts.

I created a writing sample and shared it with a friend, and the question arose
as to how to protect certain routes from premature viewing. I took a look at
using Lambda@Edge and AWS Cognito in order to secure S3 resources requested by
CloudFront, but it seems like a lot of work...it's not like anybody will really
read that post anyways. I think it would be good practice down the line, but I
also don't want to dump energy into something for my personal blog when I can be
dumping more energy into

Speaking of energy, my parents strongly recommended to not visit any grocery
stores during this time and only handle delivery items. I really, really wish
Trader Joe's did delivery. I also wish I wasn't addicted to Trader Joe's and
that their stuff wasn't so awesome. But then again if it wasn't, I wouldn't miss
it. First-world problems make life complicated.

I locked my phone up in my Kitchen Safe for 14 hours yesterday!! Got so much
work done (because otherwise I would go insane) and it was so successful I think
I'll keep locking it up. I think I'll set my Kitchen Safe to unlock during the
day so that I can call my parents for a liveness check and to get information,
then lock it up for a full 24 hours so that way I'm even less tempted to use it.
I already configured IFTTT applets for my Google assistant, and I have my trusty
notepad and pen, so it's not like my sleep log will suffer anyways.

I saw a great Reddit picture today about a baby being born. Hello baby! Post
titled something like "no matter what happens, life goes on".
