I just finished this legendary book, and I must say that it lives up to the
hype. It's not a book about extraordinary legends or deeds (though some of the
stories within do seem legendary after my personal experiences in negotiation
and lack thereof). What makes this book remarkable is just how ordinary the
situations are. Talking to a landlord about overpaid rent. Getting insurance
money for a used car. A divorced couple arguing about child support. Very banal
discussions that have large consequences on individuals. The way the discussions
are highlighted, though, demonstrate at least for me just how far away I am from
being able to manage a negotiable situation. The bright side is, it also
highlights a roadmap to get there.

The authors made three very good points in the book that I'd like to highlight:

- **Everyone is a negotiator, all the time.** When a grocery store says that the
  price of a can of beans is $1.50, what they're really saying is, $1.50 _take
  it or leave it_. It's largely a cultural assumption that some things are
  negotiable and some things aren't, whereas the truth is everything is
  negotiable to some degree. Going back to the grocery store example, I remember
  when a cashier waived the price of some bananas, because I (politely and not
  in a Karen way) raised a concern over a difference in price expectations. How
  we behave, how we talk, and how we think foundationally become how we
  negotiate and how successful those negotiations are.

- **Negotiation is power.** People like to differentiate between "soft power"
  and "hard power", and I think this book discusses extensively the benefits of
  soft power with respect to negotiation. Much like ["The Laws of
  Power"](/posts/2017/12/29/laws_of_power), this book makes no claim to "right"
  and "wrong". Unlike the former though, this book argues strongly for
  practicing "soft power" through negotiation, with positive results that speak
  for themselves.

- **Negotiation takes practice.** The book highlights different examples of
  tense situations (e.g. two children arguing over who should get the orange,
  two students arguing over a library window being open or closed), and then
  highlights how a great negotiator is able to make an agreement over
  differences (giving one child the peel to make cakes and the other child the
  fruit to eat, opening a window in another room to circulate fresh air without
  causing a draft). These are both examples I didn't think I would have thought
  to make, even after gaining additional context. It's so straightforward in
  retrospect, but forces a need to understand in the moment. I want to make a
  strong negotiating ability part of my [System
  1](/posts/2018/08/19/thinking_fast_and_slow).

I'm going to put this book on my personal bookshelf, because I'd like to have it
and re-read it in the years to come.
