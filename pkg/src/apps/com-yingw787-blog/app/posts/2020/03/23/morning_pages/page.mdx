Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of partial lockdown. To alleviate fear and
stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together
on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief
thoughts.

---

This week was the first week I forgot to submit my Pioneer weekly update on
time. At least, that's the email I woke up to. Pretty concerning because most
people probably need less than _9 weeks_ in order to get somewhere. I managed to
submit something and keep my progress, but it was spooky that I could lose
progress.

On a more positive note, I did manage to create some IFTTT applets for my sleep
log. I can register certain phrases with my Google Home, and then send myself
emails for sleep log events. It's not my full routine, because usually I fall
asleep to Calm's Sleep Stories that I play on my phone, and since Calm doesn't
have a public API, I can't wire it to the Google Home (would have to scrape
media assets and send them instead), but now if I locked my phone up until past
midnight I wouldn't be worried I don't know the time.

I also added a new cooking website @ https://cooking.yingw787.com. Hopefully
this spurs me to cook more because having only one recipe is a bit lame. Also
appreciate how much effort went into
[`hugo-minimo-theme`](https://github.com/MunifTanjim/minimo), the theme I'm
using (and a good number of hugo themes besides) weren't all that great.

I sense my mood fluctuates with the weather. Today, it's gray, cold, and rainy,
and I feel lethargic and unmotivated. Strangely enough, it's actually a great
day to go outside. Any virus in the air should be caught my the rain, and the
sidewalks should also be fresher. I shouldn't let this opportunity go to waste.

I found this picture this weekend, but I couldn't get it because I blocked
Reddit on my laptop and locked up my phone. Look at this puppy! I love
everything about this picture.
