Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of partial lockdown. To alleviate fear and
stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together
on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief
thoughts.

---

Well, one reason to sleep with your phone is if you have a Calm membership and
wish to listen to Sleep Stories. I love "The Velveteen Rabbit" and "The Big Bad
Wolf Learns Anger Management". I find these stories soothing, and as I used my
phone in the evening for the first time in two days, quite cathartic.

One reason not to sleep with your phone is the news you might wake up to in the
morning. Apparently [President Trump says states are lying about their
ventilator
needs](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-claims-us-states-dont-need-amount-ventilators-theyre-asking-i-dont-believe-you-need-1494599),
which for me confirms my suspicions that the shortage is artificial. It sounds
crazy before, but maybe a bit prophetic now, but one reason I didn't want to
move to New York City last year was because of the population density and the
lack of hard power representation within the federal government. The D.C. metro
area is quite spread out, and filled to the brim with military folks who are
good at following orders and who the President needs if he himself wants to stay
alive, like it or not. It is kind of crazy to think a POTUS will let America's
greatest city perish out of sheer pettiness, but [I don't put anything past this
president](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/10/bill-taylor-testimony-ukraine-quid-pro-quo),
and I [definitely shouldn't
now](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-19/trump-told-governors-to-buy-own-virus-supplies-then-outbid-them).

Here's [one comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22453381) I made about
the coronavirus, as of writing this, 27 days ago, and [one top-level
response](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22453530) dismissing my concerns:

> I’m starting to take some precautionary measures even here in Virginia.

My God, here's [another comment I
made](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22111815) 66 days ago, and two
top-level comments, [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22113628) and
[here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22112475) dismissing my concerns:

Now 20,000+ people are dead, and POTUS45 wants to reopen the country by Easter
Sunday which if it happens will result in likely hundreds of thousands of people
dead, if not millions, by the end of the year. I'm also expecting Dr. Anthony
Fauci, the head of NIAID (because the CDC is nowhere to be found), also looks
like he might get fired soon for contradicting POTUS45 and making him look bad.
And this is nowhere **_near_** my nightmare scenario...but it's inching there,
slowly but surely.

[Here's](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22699560) a comment I made
yesterday, partially copied here:

I'm such a happy ball of fluff, aren't I? If you're as gullible as I am, the
answer is no, this is all quite terribly depressing. So here's a cute picture!!

You know what, that's not enough (sorry Mr. Floof!), so here's another picture!!

That'll have to do :smile:
