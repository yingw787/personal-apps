Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of (partial? I can't even tell anymore)
lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my writer's group has put together a
daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before
starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Blegh.

I've now been home (parent's home) more than a full week, and I have to say I am
sooooo productive when I'm at home. It's actually really nice being around other
people, and having air conditioning and food security and all that good stuff I
don't get in Arlington. I don't think I was this productive since last
December...when I was also working at home...maybe I should think about this and
why this is.

Umm not sure if anybody reads this, but I got my first software contracting gig!
It doesn't seem to be all that bad...especially because it's an MVP and I'm the
only one controlling everything. So I've been really productive, and not had to
have to worry about anybody telling me what to do. I guess one thing that I'm
not happy with is how I'm pretty much hapless at most low-code tools like Heroku
now. I've been so focused on getting my app shipped "the right way" that I can't
use those services (because they assume things about your code). Oh man, I wish
I can land more gigs like this by asking whether these guys have any friends who
need apps built. That'd be sweet. Eh, worst comes to worst I'll ship the app,
ask for a testimonial, and start a company (with said testimonial as my first
customer reference).

Also I really love watermelon. Not sure what compelled me to say this. But I
missed watermelon. It's not economical to eat one all by yourself, so you had to
settle for the small plastic boxes that cost a bagillion dollars each.
