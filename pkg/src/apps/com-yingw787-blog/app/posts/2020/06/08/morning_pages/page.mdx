Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

This rabbit is a tad more responsible than I am:

This weekend was pretty depressing. I was pretty sure the police or the military
would begin using live rounds on protesters, and [I think there were plans to do
so](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-demanded-10000-active-duty-troops-deploy-to-streets-in-heated-oval-office-meeting/),
but apparently the military refused to play along. So I guess [like the start of
the Syrian Civil
War](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Syrian_Civil_War_(January%E2%80%93April_2011)>),
the President will be forced to fly in loyalist mercenaries like
[Wagner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagner_Group) or
[Blackwater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academi), if he wants to start his
own version of Tiananmen Square. God knows, there's enough people in this
country who would [support
that](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/tom-cotton-protests-military.html),
without caring for the actual consequences of such actions. Things never go
quite the way you expect. So I checked the news, hour after hour, in lieu of
actually going to the protests myself (...because we still have a pandemic...),
and that cratered my resolve to actually do anything productive during my
weekend.

Sigh. I think this is just the beginning, things will get worse this year. USPS
is scheduled to collapse around September, November will be...tricky...and we
haven't even hit the second (and most likely third) waves of the pandemic yet.
Not to mention the previous civil war trope the President keeps pushing for.
Plenty of opportunity for chaos to rear its head.

During this time, I would _really_ like to remain functional in my own personal
duties and responsibilities. I mean, the whole point of me working by myself is
so that during difficult times, I would be able to keep the lights on over my
head, instead of trusting and relying on others to do so for me. I am failing in
that regards, and I need to get back on track.

I switched over my monthly donation from my community church over to St. John's
Episcopal Church of Washington, D.C. It's not much ($10), but I like to think I
put my money where my mouth is, and they got tear gassed while offering medical
assistance to the wounded and injured, so I think they better uphold Christian
ideals of suffering for the vulnerable.
