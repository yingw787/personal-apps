Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

I cut my own hair yesterday!! And it doesn't look half bad!!

I think back left is a bit messed up, because I didn't have a second mirror and
I was cutting my hair in the bathtub vs. on the ground so I didn't have the
first mirror, but I think it does the job and doesn't look too different from my
regular haircuts (#3 on the top, #1 on the side, blend together vs. here which
is #5 everywhere). So much cheaper than going to the barbershop too! My electric
clipper only cost $30, while a haircut costs $25 minimum! Hopefully, I'll never
need to go to the barbershop again.

By contrast, this is what I looked like before the haircut:

It was really annoying to have that much hair. It's like a furry animal living
on top of your head and getting into your eyes when you run.

I think some lessons I learned are, have your after-shower clothes + towel ready
before you cut your hair, keep your haircutting equipment closer to the bathroom
to avoid having to grab it one by one, and you can't really avoid using a mirror
and going by feel alone, because of stray hairs.

I'm really happy about this increased ability for self-reliance and
independence!

Maybe next time, I'll try something fancier, like a fade or something. [This

Today I feel mildly burnt out. I think the haircutting thing was pretty
stressful, because you can't uncut hair and because there were a good number of
unknowns (like how painful it might be to accidentally take away a piece of my
own scalp or something dumb like that). Weekend wasn't productive, no great
surprise there, and while I think I had a major breakthrough this past week, it
isn't over until it's shipped and in the hands of users.

So, yeah. Drink wine, people. :wine_glass:
