Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Oh man, it's been a full week since I've gone to morning writes. Last week was
pretty crazy. I started running out of food near the end, _ish_ not really, but
I had to eat the same stuff over and over again and even doing that cratered my
productivity and I'm only just now getting over it.

I did go back home (to Michigan), and I think I'll stay here for a few weeks in
order to get some nice home-cooked food from mom and dad. Yeah, I really didn't
know how lucky I was when I was younger, but I'm glad I have some appreciation
now.

I haven't been working on TinyDev as much as I should. I did discover this new
platform called FocusMate, which is basically just virtual co-working between
two people. I tried it out, I liked it, I think it'll help me focus better, and
it's only $5 / mo. (though the price might change later).

I've been thinking about how simple happiness is. There was this one girl in
first grade called Lauren, who always talked about her rabbits and how they were
her most favorite thing in the world. I called BS at the time (I was pretty
jaded...by first grade), but now I think she's right. Happiness is rabbits, or
butterflies, or whatever is simple and brings a smile to your face. It's kind of
crazy how adults have to spend inordinate amounts of time and treasure running
in circles, when the answer is right in front of our faces.
