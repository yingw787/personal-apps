Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

If I fits, I sits:

This is why people make pockets, it's for our pocket kittens.

It's raining pretty heavily in Arlington, and there's a flash flood warning in
effect. It's kind of the perfect backdrop for the situation we're all in. Even
though I live on the second floor of my apartment complex, and even though I
sleep better in heavy rain, it still sucks for many people who aren't as lucky,
and so it is with the recession (depression?), the race riots, the pandemic, the
election, the curfew, and so on. So waking up to bright sunlight is pretty nice
-- after the darkness comes the dawn, and there always will be a dawn. Unless
the scorch the sky like in the Matrix, then there is no dawn.
