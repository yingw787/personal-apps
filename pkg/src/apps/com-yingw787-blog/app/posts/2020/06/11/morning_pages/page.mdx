Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Peekaboo!

I'm not quite sure if I'm the most obtuse person on this planet, but yesterday I
found out that not only did I not know my friends were engaged, not only did I
not know they were dating, but I didn't even know what their orientation was. I
think looking back it makes a lot more sense, but this feels like I'm not living
under a rock, but rather glued to a tectonic plate as it subducts underneath an
ocean floor.

I think I'm mostly fine with this. Not the engagement, totally fine with that,
but with my own obtuseness. I've been pretty obtuse and gullible most of my
life, and I think I just have to accept it. To be honest, I'm not quite sure how
I would get better, even if I knew for sure I wanted it. I don't think being out
of touch with people to this degree is a good sign of social skills.

It's disappointing, but ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ what can I do, you know.

Life does seem to be returning to normal, to some degree. It's surprising
because the pandemic is still going off (or really taking off again), and we
have the protests still going on. I think. I'm not sure whether it's because
I've been closeted away for so long, or if other people have been closeted away
for so long, but nobody really talks about the fact that they're living under
social distancing guidelines, and a curfew anymore. I get it, no point beating a
dead horse, but it's surprising because I thought more people would be
disappointed with their freedom of movement stripped away. Instead we're all
kind of just getting used to it.

I don't know if that's good or bad, but when I think about this I get this eerie
feeling. They say COVID-19 might be around...well, forever, like the bubonic
plague at this point, and until there's a vaccine things won't get back to
normal. So, um, yeah. I think it'll be good to start planning my life around
this thing. Especially because there'll probably be more stuff hitting the fan
later this year.
