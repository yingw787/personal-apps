Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Today I feel tired. I think I'm sleeping too late, and watching too much news,
which seems rather funereal. I'm also not eating as regularly as I should be,
and not filling in my habit tracker and my journals as I need to be. I think I
just have to take it easy, and do things one step at a time. I've failed before,
and climbed back out, and this time shouldn't be any different.
