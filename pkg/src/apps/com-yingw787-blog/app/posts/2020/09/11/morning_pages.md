Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

So I have one serious and one funny picture/video for y'all today. Here's a
doggo working the old Ground Zero site, since today is September 11th and bad
things happen to you again if you forget them:

And here's a doggo playing tic-tac-toe! IMHO he should have gotten an entire
bowl of treats for how he completed a human-grade challenge:

I think fall is really starting to kick in. I'm starting to get chills and
sneezing all the time when I'm going to bed and I think it's because there's not
enough layers I'm wearing during the day.

Also my parent's squash is ready to eat and I've been eating that for the past
two days. I didn't even know they grew squash.
