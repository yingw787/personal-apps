Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

So fun fact, I had accidentally wiped my hard drive last week, and I failed to
save any backups, so I had to set everything up from scratch. I took the
opportunity to convert some of the infrastructure from my old `bash` scripting
approach to a `make` approach w/ deployment via AWS CloudFormation. It was kind
of a PITA, and I had put it off for years. And the thing that got me to do it?
Being able to share this video!

I thought it was a dog at first, then I realized it was a baby cow and then I
had to get everything up and running again.

I think Arts, Beats, and Eats came by my neighborhood yesterday! I was going out
for a walk and I saw a few food trucks come by. [Arts, Beats, and
Eats](http://artsbeatseats.com/) is a show that typically takes place around
September in my parent's county, and usually it's a big blast. This year, it's a
bunch of smaller blasts, and I guess the food trucks are going from neighborhood
to neighborhood in order to avoid tempting larger crowds gathering in any one
location. I like the concept! Also liked smelling everything from a distance; I
didn't have a mask on at the time, and didn't bring my wallet, so I couldn't buy
anything.
