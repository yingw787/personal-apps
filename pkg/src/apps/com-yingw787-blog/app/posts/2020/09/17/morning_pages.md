Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

Oh man, there was this one picture on Reddit (and I was trying to find it) that
had a picture of a piece of paper on the wall, and it said "I love you. I don't
know you, but if people can hate others without knowing them, I can love others
without knowing them" and now I can't find that picture :confused:

Well, in lieu of that picture, I found this one. Something isn't beautiful
because it lasts:

I think this week was the first time I went outside my neighborhood. I'm not
exactly cringing in the corner of my apartment like Osama Bin Laden, but I
haven't really walked outside my neighborhood since I got home (the last two
months or so). I think the fear (or maybe really novelty) of the virus is
wearing off for a lot of people, they're starting to do other stuff again. One
friend came back from a 10-day roadtrip to Colorado, my writing group is having
hybrid virtual/physical meetups, and my church friends are gathering for Bible
studies outside. It just seems really weird, I feel like I'm one of the last
people I know, apart from my parents, who are still absolutely terrified of the
virus and will lock myself down completely. I get it though. My life is pretty
boring all-around, and while I can get used to living the lockdown life forever
it's not for everybody.

I've heard others say 2020 might just be the best year of the rest of our lives,
which if true will take some getting used to.
