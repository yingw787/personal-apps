Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

I think this weekend I felt pretty tired. I think the news is starting to get to
me. It's like watching a train wreck that melts your eyeballs, it hurts but you
can't turn away. Man, ignorance would be bliss in times like this. It'd probably
also be fatal but it'd also be bliss.

I just want to be able to sleep regularly. Hopefully when I move back to
Virginia, I'll be able to make some adjustments to my routine.
