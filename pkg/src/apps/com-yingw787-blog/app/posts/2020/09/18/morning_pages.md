Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

I thought maybe today I'll take a detour from just cute animals to funny
animals. Apparently this Bison is created using deep learning:

Or a Muppet actually, you know, did stuff with a bison and this is what
happened. Whatever you want to believe, it's 2020.

On that note, I should pick up deep learning because I want my own animal
combinations. This is just too good to pass up.

I feel a little sad that I'm pretty much leaving myself out of social
get-togethers at the moment. I pretty much distrust completely the re-opening
guidelines from states and cities because I don't think they're opening due to a
lack of tax revenue from people doing normal things. But others don't, and it
just seems like everybody is getting their lives back together while I'm still
hunkering down. I wonder if I'll still be hunkering down long after this is
over, just like my own little North Korea in my apartment, saying that the world
is a dark scary place while other people go to the mall and the fair and to
restaurants and stuff. That'd be really sad. Right now, I think I've mistrusted
myself enough, and the stakes are high enough, where I'll keep hunkering down a
little bit longer.

I'm 90% sure the president will be re-elected, and that the pandemic will likely
go on until 2024, 2025 maybe. I was thinking about moving to a different
country, like say France (it has nuclear weapons, a country that has risen from
the ashes innumerable times before, and likes protesting pretty much
everything), but I'm not sure how serious I am about this. I don't like the idea
of running away from my problems. Maybe time will help clarify things.
