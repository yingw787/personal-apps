I recently went back home for the holidays, and was talking about work with a
friend from high school, who's now a dental student. We had an interesting
conversation about work-life balance:

> Friend: When I come home from the dentistry, I turn on the TV, and turn into a

> Me, from a few short years ago: Man, that sounds so lame. Why don't you work

> Me, today: That sounds so healthy. I wish I could do that.

I can't relax like a normal person, like I physically can't do it. Multiple
people have pointed that out. For the longest time I've prided myself as one of
[Paul Graham's "animals"](http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html):

> If you think about people you know, you'll find the animal test is easy to
> apply. Call the person's image to mind and imagine the sentence "so-and-so is
> an animal". If you laugh, they're not. You don't need or perhaps even want

Maybe I'm going through a bit of an identity crisis, or maybe crisis has been my
identity all these years, but I don't know if I want this anymore, this _drive_
I've worked years and years to attain. You might not figure it if you met me on
the street, but I don't think of myself as successful, and I haven't for many,
many years. It's simply not part of my identity.

Failure is. I've accepted no amount of drive can change that.

So this year, as per my [New Year's
Resolution](/posts/2020/01/01/new_years_resolutions) to "learn to love myself",
I'm making my feelings mentionable and manageable by making this statement
publicly accessible and in writing. I wish I could lock down individual URL
routes with a passcode and share it with friends only, but I'm done waiting for
things to be perfect. I want to change this part of myself now and I'm willing
to risk doing things differently.

## Background

Many situations left a long-lasting impression on my personality.

I had a heart condition called supraventricular tachycardia or SVT that made me
go to the ER around 30 times in three years when I was 10-12 y/o (including 4
instances in an ambulance). It's fixed now, but I still check the time on my
watch frequently, because I feel like time I'm getting isn't mine to have.

Our home got broken into in 7th grade. The police did nothing. It introduced a
deep sense of insecurity by removing the safety of a physical "home", a
resentment towards society, and a distrust of its teachings (e.g. "police are
there to protect and serve"). Today, I leave my apartment mostly unfurnished,
and I don't like owning things, because I figure everything I physically own
also partially belongs to the guy who will inevitably break in and steal it.
Five more robberies over the years reinforced this notion.

I still hold my breath when entering public restrooms (even in four-star hotels)
from a habit I picked up in first grade, when the custodian never bothered to
clean the boy's bathroom properly and the stench made it hard to breathe.

I don't think any of this is particularly unique or notable (I had a friend in
sixth grade who'd been robbed six times by then, including one time where his
mom had to physically beat a robber out from underneath his bed with a baseball
bat), but I do think childhood trauma and behavioral traits, which for me
include seeing work as a form of escape, are much more ["kernel-space" than
"user-space"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space). They're much more
difficult to change. Not only are childhood traits far more deeply ingrained,
but they're oftentimes invisible. Those traits have been with us longer than
we've possessed a fully-formed logical side. _Our logic develops around our
illogicity_.

---

By the time I started high school, I've historically hit enough edge cases in
life where I came to expect the worst scenario out of a spectrum of possible
scenarios. That, combined with insecurity about going from a not-excellent
primary school in Canada to a magnet high school in the U.S., resulted in an
innate pessimism, deep-seated anger issues, and a _serious_ axe to grind. That
saying, "youth is wasted on the young"? That wasn't going to be me. So I worked
to escape my problems.

I got what I worked for. I got the grades and GPA, honor roll, and state-level
awards. I got into college. Most importantly, I'm fortunate enough to have
_choice_ in where I want to go in my life. _Choice is wealth_. And yet, if
you've just walked the beaten path faster than others, and you think departing
from that path imparts a cost, _how much choice do you really have_?

## $RACHEL

They say [Helen of Troy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_of_Troy) was the
face that launched a thousand ships.

I first saw $RACHEL December 8th, 2007, my first day of middle school and school
in the U.S. If you ask my friends, they will say I'm not a remembering type of
guy. I don't like to remember much these days, but I remember that day just
fine. I remember being terrified that all middle school students in the U.S.
study calculus, and had hurriedly tried to read through Barron's "Painless
Algebra" before school started. I was terrified that I would need to defend
myself against the kind of bullying that went on back home.

I needn't have worried. The moment I saw her, laughing in the cafeteria with her
friends, I thought to myself, "maybe America isn't so scary after all".

We ended up going to the same high school. You would think this is the point
where I should ask her out, go on a few dates, realize we're incompatible, and
then break up. That's not what happened. I didn't understand this feeling, and
that crime boss dude in "Batman Begins" nails it on the head when he says "you
always fear what you don't understand". I also saw a tradeoff between time
studying and prospective time chasing her. If you study and fail, you'll
probably get something out of it. If you chase girls and fail, you'll just get a
broken heart.

And a broken heart is the worst thing that could happen to you! Right?

I succeeded in tamping down my feelings for a while. Then I couldn't.

I wanted to go home. Home is where the heart is.

The second date seared into my mind is September 26th, 2011. I even remember the
time and location, 2:45PM ET in the art room. I wrote $RACHEL a letter about how
I felt about her, and sealed it into a manila envelope. I was too scared to give
it to her myself, so I gave it to a mutual friend who promised to deliver it
when the time is right. That's the point in space and time where I accepted I
would never be hers and she would never be mine.

Great, so that's a wrap. Now it's a simple matter of letting her go.

---

I cried myself to sleep almost every day for the first three years of college. I
became terrified of falling asleep because when I closed my eyes I saw her. A
ghost, a mental projection now, that I involuntarily placed on a pedestal, with
that shimmering hair and that gorgeous smile. I wanted to forget her and move
on. I didn't want to forget. I didn't want to move on. Today, I'm more of a
night owl, because I've developed a habit of delaying going to bed.

I realized that hard work didn't make me happy. I've walked halls of gold and
marble, seen giant pallets of money moved back and forth by robotic forklifts,
cavorted with millionaires and billionaires and future and aspiring millionaires
and billionaires. I never wanted any of it. I wanted a quiet life with somebody
I deeply wanted, somebody who could make me feel the same way I felt about
$RACHEL. When I realized that, the house I've built for myself started to look a
lot like firewood. Somehow, I chose a prison. The harder I worked, and the more
I tried to forget about $RACHEL, the more the feeling intensified, and the more
underlined the past becomes. It's like a fire that can never go out, even if you
dump an ocean of water on top of it. It's like blood you can never wash off.
_And for some reason, I chose this_. It's partially why I didn't go into
investment banking and high finance, and became a software engineer instead. I
_knew_ I cared about more than just money, so I wanted to keep my options open,
since there are intense software engineering jobs and laid-back software
engineering jobs.

Okay, so go look for somebody else. Easy peasy lemon squeazy, right? Except that
you can't compare a person with a ghost. The ghost is infalliable and
ever-present. I could take $RACHEL the physical person and compare her with the
ghost, and the ghost would win, because the ghost doesn't complain, doesn't get
sad or mad, doesn't set boundaries, and isn't real. Not just that, but feeling
like that for anybody else almost seems like a betrayal, and brings about a
feeling of intense pain. Intense, as in I physically feel a 30-pound weight
pressing on my heart no matter how I orient myself, and an intense burning
sensation in my eyes, nose, and my throat. So I can't move on.

I mentioned in my New Year's Resolutions this year that I hated myself, every
fiber of my being, everything I am. I hope this explains why. Youth is wasted on
the young.

At this point, I think I should clarify some things. Absolutely none of this is
on $RACHEL. We've probably talked for less than an hour over twelve years, and I
only know her as one of the sweetest, kindest, most patient people I've ever
met. I'm biased, but I honestly can't think of a time when she said or did
anything mean to anybody. And although I would do so many things differently,
I'm so grateful that $RACHEL stepped into my life. Wanting her taught me so much
about how to become the man I wanted to become. I'd much rather keep the lessons
(and the innate understanding over their importance, internalized through pain)
rather be ignorant and probably realize this later on in life when there's more
at stake. There _are_ much worse fates, like those discussed in ["Regrets of the
Dying"](/five_regrets), where this would fit in as "I wish I had the courage to
express my feelings".

I wanted to do a limited post on failure, but I realized that for me, it's
impossible to talk about failure without talking about $RACHEL. Not only do all
the failures I've accumulated in my life pale in comparison to my failure in
expressing my feelings in a healthy way to $RACHEL, but in some way they all
seem connected. Not just in stateful way, where the person I am today makes my
present-day decisions, but almost in a procedural way. Like a cornerstone of an
arch clicking into place, there's no other failure in my life that's as deeply
rooted to my present-day identity.

## Lessons Learned

- **I don't rule my feelings. If anything, they rule me. They are me.** I
  neglected my emotional side, and thought that I could "control" it, like an
  adversary. Not only is my emotional side not an adversary, it's more powerful
  than my logical side. Again, we were emotional way before we were logical.
  Without the "why" in life, the "how" is irrelevant. I read ["Everything is
  Fucked" by Mark Manson](/posts/2019/11/01/everything_is_f_ed), who hammers
  home this central and absolutely critical point.

  I think that's why people say "do what you love" or "do what makes you happy".
  There are healthy animals, and unhealthy animals. Healthy animals obsess over
  their work, but they have a clear emotional boundary, which is "do I still
  want to do this tonight", and when they don't feel it, they stop. Unhealthy
  animals obsess over work because they're afraid. Since reasoning about fear
  with incomplete information isn't really possible, that fear becomes
  all-consuming. Things like relaxing don't seem okay. Then the limit is a
  physical limit (you collapse at work or something), which is far more
  difficult to recover from.

- **The heart wants what it wants, and it's the mind's job to satisfy that.** If
  I could go back, I would burn down all my studies and my extracurricluars in
  high school, just to spend five minutes with her at my side. Not only because
  I ended up burning it all down anyways and switching to a completely different
  field, but because without the "why" of studying, it kind of _is_ all firewood.

  I think that's why it's important to ask for what you want. If you want a
  higher salary, you should ask for it instead of being grumpy at work, or study
  harder and find a better job (of which for software engineers there is always
  work to do). If you're mad at a friend, you should tell them you're unhappy
  and why you're unhappy and what could be done differently to prevent such
  unhappiness in the future, rather than break things off abruptly or be
  irrationally unhappy in a different situation.

  The heart wants what it wants, and it will get what it wants eventually. You
  can't stop it, or at least I can't, and I'd say my mental faculties are up
  there.

- **Tackling problems head-on is the best way to find a solution.** When I
  wanted to conquer my fear of heights, I climbed up every tall building I
  could, culminating in jumping out of an airplane (which I'd like to point out
  is much easier than asking somebody out). Voila, my fear of heights has
  greatly diminished.

  Avoiding something because of fear leads to suffering without purpose. It
  doesn't do to suffer, let alone suffer without purpose. It's pointless, there
  is no reward or recognition for doing so. So don't do it, or learn how not to
  do it.

## How I Cope With Failure Today

For me, this is shaping up to be the year of ripping off Band-Aids. Ripping off
Band-Aids hurts, but it's important to do so, and avoid building a life made up
of chewing gum, baling wire, and duct tape. So I wanted to share things I do to
keep myself on track.

- **Relaxation is a muscle.** You use your ability to relax, or it atrophies
  like any other muscle. I never thought I would see the day when I just
  wouldn't relax, and now I think I might not see the day when I can relax. So
  practice and be good at relaxing. Otherwise, relaxing will be as hard as going
  to the gym.

  Relaxing can be anything that makes you happy. If it requires a skill, then it
  might take some willpower. I'm trying to learn the ukelele, and I've skipped
  two weeks of studying. I have to practice self-forgiveness and envision a life
  where I have learned how to play the ukelele to keep at it.

- **Get smacked flat by a feels train.** Sometimes, you don't control how you
  feel about something. I sometimes scream into a pillow until I'm hoarse,
  because I'd rather have a sore throat than a sore heart. I think I can replace
  that with crying, or maybe tweaking on a curb, because vocal cords don't last
  if you don't treat them right.

  Anything is better than a sore heart.

- **Mentally GOTO to the worst-case scenario, then work your way back up the
  stack.** I take the nightmare, and apply layerings of reasoning and
  rationalizations to tell myself how this nightmare may or may not be unlikely,
  so that if the nightmare happens, I'll have a mental "ladder" I can use to
  climb out of the hole. It's honestly a bit hard to explain.

## Conclusion

A few months (?) ago, I made [this comment on Hacker

People disagreed with me, but somehow I don't think I'm wrong.

In the end, after you've taken care of your heart, you can truly figure out what
you enjoy when your thinking side is attuned to your feeling side. That's what
makes life enjoyable. For example, I enjoy learning about Haskell and having
conversations with my friends about it:

> Me: Monads are applicative functors.
>
> Friend: I'm not sure if you know this Ying, but most people just Google shit
> and call themselves a full-stack developer and make six figures and have a good
> life.

> Me: (>.>) (satisfied noises)
