This book was the second of a classics series by [Princeton University
Press](https://press.princeton.edu/), the first of which was ["On
Anger"](/posts/2019/11/07/on_anger). This book describes Cicero's views on
friendship, in a letter to a best friend based in Greece named Atticus. Cicero
describes what makes up a good friendship, based on his then-sixty years of
experience making them.

I really enjoyed reading this book. It flows very well, which is quite
surprising given the Latin to English translation, and I'm guessing the
formalism regarded to a former Roman consul (a head of state during the Roman
Republic). It seems very genuine. Cicero's letter demonstrated to me just how
constant many things about people are throughout the ages, and how the same
things end up mattering to everyone.
