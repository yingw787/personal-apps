**DO NOT STAND AT MY GRAVE AND WEEP**

**I AM NOT THERE**

**I DO NOT SLEEP**

**I AM A THOUSAND WINDS THAT BLOW**

**I AM THE DIAMOND GLINTS ON SNOW**

**I AM THE SUNLIGHT ON RIPENED GRAIN**

**I AM THE GENTLE AUTUMN RAIN**

**WHEN YOU AWAKE IN THE MORNING'S HUSH**

**I AM THE SWIFT UPLIFTING RUSH**

**OF QUIET BIRDS IN CIRCLED FLIGHT**

**I AM THE SOFT STARS THAT SHINE AT NIGHT**

**DO NOT STAND AT MY GRAVE AND CRY**

**I AM NOT THERE**

**I DID NOT DIE**

**WE ARE NOT NOW THAT STRENGTH**

**WHICH IN OLD DAYS MOVED EARTH AND HEAVEN**

**THAT WHICH WE ARE, WE ARE**

**ONE EQUAL TEMPER OF HEROIC HEARTS**

**MAKE WEAK BY TIME AND FATE**

**BUT STRONG IN WILL**

**TO STRIVE, TO SEEK, TO FIND**

**AND NOT TO YIELD**

> "Ulysses", by Alfred, Lord Tennyson

**DO NOT GO GENTLE INTO THAT GOOD NIGHT**

**OLD AGE SHOULD BURN AND RAVE AT CLOSE OF DAY**

**RAGE, RAGE AGAINST THE DYING OF THE LIGHT**

**TO MY HUSBAND**

**I'M SORRY I COULDN'T BE THERE TO HELP YOU SETUP OUR TREE**

**I HAD A RIDE TO CATCH**

**AND IT WAS JUST MY TIME TO GO**

**I KNOW IT ISN'T FAIR**

**NOT FOR YOU AND NOT FOR ME**

**BUT REMEMBER ALL THE LITTLE THINGS WE SHARED**

**ALL OF OUR MEMORIES AND DREAMS**

**YOU DIDN'T BURY THEM WHEN YOU BURIED ME**

**AND I TRUST YOU'RE KEEPING ALL OF THEM SAFE**

**FOR THAT DAY IN ANOTHER UNIVERSE OR PLANE**

**WHEN I'LL GET TO LAUGH WITH YOU AGAIN**

**LIVE YOUR LIFE FOR YOU**

**I ALREADY GOT TO LIVE MINE**

**AND THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR THE JOURNEY**

**MOST PEOPLE WOULD BE LUCKY**

**TO BE LOVED**

**THE WAY YOU STILL LOVE ME**
