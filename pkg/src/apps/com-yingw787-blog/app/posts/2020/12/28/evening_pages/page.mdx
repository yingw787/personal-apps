Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

I love it when animals make carbon copies of themselves. Especially when they're
already cute. It's like cuteness and then more cute slathered on top because
they're smaller.

Case in point:

It's the end of the year coming up, and I'm putting together a set of
(hopefully) comprehensive datasets that detail how my year went. Hopefully, I'll
be able to do this every year, and I'll be able to invest in things that don't
change. To that end, I built myself a small test database harness that should
allow me to enter in data via a nice command line called `pgcli` (with
auto-complete to help discover commands). I was hoping to find a
spreadsheet-like data entry tool (...like a database-backed spreadsheet web
application that sits on top of PostgREST and PostGraphile, like the one I was
meaning to build during the latter half of my sabbatical), but I don't think
I've found a good app. Closest thing might be PostGUI, but I think it might be
more of a research project rather than a coupled solution. I might just dump the
data in there for recording this year since I want to run analytics and do some
dataviz stuff (e.g. y-axes for my sleep log are pretty messed up), but long term
I might want a better solution. I am glad that I'm proceeding with the
de-Googlification of my life though. I think the only major service I use from
Google is Gmail, and I guess whenever Gmail becomes too hard to use for some
reason and there's a real competitor, I'll migrate away from Gmail to there and
just call it.

I don't think people mention my haircut! I walked from my apartment to DC and
back and nobody said anything. I feel a good deal less self-conscious now.
