I've continued to track my sleep on and off the course of this year, and now I'm
going to do a review of how my sleep patterns have shaped up. All in all, I
think I started off the year pretty good, and then kinda just slowly slid back
and back. For some reason, I find it much easier to be a night owl than an early
bird. I know I should wake up early. But knowing and doing are two different
things. Given everything that's happened this year, I think it's healthier to
let the past be and worry about the future. So let's just try to understand it.

I created the above chart by entering in times to go to bed, fall asleep, wake
up, and get out of bed over the course of the year in a Google sheet, then
imported into PostgreSQL, then synced with a Jupyter notebook. I think overall
its a bit shittier than the Google chart natively embedded within Sheets, but
it's mine and it's free (as in beer), and it'll get better as time goes on.

Some interesting things to note:

- **There's a lot more variablitiy in the morning than there is in the
  evening**: I go to bed and fall asleep usually within a 2 hour timeframe
  (which isn't great), and I wake up and get up within a 5 hour timeframe. So
  motivations and discipline to get up in the morning is going to be important
  going forwards.

- **Definitely backslid from the beginning of the year in terms of bedtime**:
  From around midnight to around 2:00AM. I should hope to correct this and get
  back to around 12:00AM time-to-bed.

Update:

I updated the graph in order to start @ 9:00PM and end sometime later (1500
minutes after 9:00PM, which would be 25 hours, which would be 10:00PM the next
day). I couldn't get the axes to work properly, I'll probably do that later at
some point. Wow, so much more flexible than Google Sheets (even though its still
early days).
