Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

This morning I'm feeling strangely warm. I think yesterday was a pretty good
day, all things considered, and I think I managed to change the dynamic enough
where my weekends will start becoming a bit more productive, or at least
enjoyably unproductive.

I was talking to my "boss" from Boss as a Service and mentioning the lack of
productivity in the morning, and she mentioned how it could be useful in order
to "pay yourself first" and get the tasks you want to do for yourself out of the
way in the morning. I think I'll give that a go today and see whether I can
start building up the habit.

I'm also interested in investing in certain clean energy ETFs. I don't think I
realized this, but since governments are literally banning fossil fuel vehicles
by 2030 (and that this policy is unlikely to change), and since batteries have
met the cost threshold of $100 / kWh to be competitive with fossil fuels,
there's really no way but up for cleantech. I don't think I have the stomach to
ride the rocket and buy TSLA or anything, but an ETF sounds safe enough.
