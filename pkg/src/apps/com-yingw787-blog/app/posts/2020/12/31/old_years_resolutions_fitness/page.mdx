So this year was a unique one in terms of exercise. Not just in the stay-at-home
orders, which means no more gym (not that I was going to the gym regularly
anyways), but also the pandemic and trying to avoid the hospital and any broken
/ sprained bones and ligaments discouraging exercise too. That, plus adjusting
to a work-from-home routine that doesn't involve long periods of sitting in
front of a screen, all resulted in a substantial backslide this year compared to
the last.

Good news is I kept a bunch of metrics throughout most of this year, and I got
around to Dockerizing that data and plotting a bunch of visualization for
certain metrics. So let's get to it.

![iphone screen time](/img/posts/2020/12/31/iphone_screen_time.png)

Hmm, for the amount of time I spend on my iPhone, I can present some
observations:

- **There's a big reduction in outliers sometime in May.** I think this is
  because I started using [Boss as a Service](https://bossasaservice.life/) at
  that time, and started reporting in times spent on my phone and prioritizing a
  decrease in screen time then.

  I am a little disappointed that the [Kitchen
  Safe](https://www.thekitchensafe.com/) I purchased for the express purpose of
  locking up my phone didn't seem to have as big of an impact as I had hoped. It
  might be because it's a bit small and cramped, in which case maybe purchasing
  a bigger bottom would be better, or because I keep it out of the way of where
  my work area is, in which case maybe I should look into getting a bigger desk.

- **I spend wayyyy too much time on my phone than I should.** I think my target
  is around 3 hours a day, but I think I usually spend up to 5-6 hours on my
  phone (or 400 minutes). A lot of times, locking up my phone in my Kitchen Safe
  is really inconvenient, I can't be reached via text, and I think some websites
  require SMS two-factor authentication instead of token-based auth (which is
  available on my laptop via Authy for Linux), so I can't log into those
  websites if I need to.

![iphone screen time](/img/posts/2020/12/31/weight_lbs.png)

Hmm. Fuck.

- **Lots of missing data.** I stopped recording my weight when I went back to my
  parent's place to Michigan for a few months, because the scale at my parent's
  place isn't all that accurate compared to my digital, self-calibrating scale
  at my place. So I lacked information on how much calories I was building up
  and not burning off until I got back to my place three months later.

  I think I should record what information I can from this point onwards,
  because 1-2 pounds variance is nothing compared to gaining 10-20 pounds over a
  few months of overeating. If possible, I should bring my scale from my place
  to my parent's place, or just purchase another scale and ship to my parent's
  place next time I stay there.

  Also parent's food is good. So at least I didn't gain weight eating McDonald's
  or some crap like that.

- **I kinda gave up latter half of the year.** I think I was really working
  towards losing weight, and I had a target of around 145 lbs (which I never
  really reached but was close to). After discovering that my weight
  skyrocketed, I became depressed and despairing and stopped caring about losing
  weight, and traded off gaining weight for mental sanity as the pandemic took
  off by stress eating. Hence the ever-increasing amount of weight gained.

  I think it's hard given a routine of sitting in one place to build another
  routine of exercising regularly over a few weeks. I still lack that capability
  to build multi-week habits. I'll need to pick that back up if I'm going to
  lose this stress weight.

Yeah gaining 40 pounds over this year is not my cup of tea. I'll need to fix
this in 2021.

![iphone screen time](/img/posts/2020/12/31/waist_size_inches.png)

- **Same shtick as weight.** Only with a lesser granularity because my waist
  usually varies by increments of half an inch for whatever reason.

  Also interesting is how waist size varies for any given period. I think my
  waist size was around 33.5'' consistently at the beginning of the year, and
  now it's 37''. I don't think I'd be able to deduce this pattern until I see
  the entire data in full.

This is probably the most depressing part of my year in review, how I failed to
keep my body healthy in ways I measured. I'm still incredibly lucky, though.
I've heard people who've gotten COVID invariably cannot exercise anymore due to
the lack of lung capacity, and I'm guessing whenever the ACA gets repealed
insurance companies will label COVID a pre-existing condition with skyrocketing
premiums, along with weight gain from inability to exercise meaningfully, will
result in a drastic decline in physical health among the U.S. population.
Compared to that I'm hella lucky (though I still might catch COVID if I'm not
careful). I can always do a better job though, and whenever I get the vaccine I
should look at exercising more and re-evaluating the risk of a broken bone or
something vs. decreased health from overweight-ness and obesity and blah blah
blah.

I think I'd rather just know things are horrible early on rather than wait until
I'm a literal beach ball of fat. This is another argument for making an in-house
database-backed spreadsheet application + streaming visualization tool; if I
don't, I might not see the bigger picture on a day-to-day basis.
