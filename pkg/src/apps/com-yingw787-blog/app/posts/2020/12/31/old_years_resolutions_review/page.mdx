Another year in the bag! And what a year it has been! Feels like thirty years
have gone by, I think I forgot all about [the New Year's Resolutions I started
this year](/posts/2020/01/01/new_years_resolutions), until maybe last week.

Let's take a stroll down memory lane and see what I planned for myself / did for
myself.

The "soft" (not measurable) resolutions:

- **<span style="color:green">Learn to love myself (MEETS / EXCEEDS
  EXPECTATIONS)</span>**: It's strange to say this year out of all years, but
  I don't think I've been happier or been at a happier point in my life than
  this year. I think it's in large part getting out of (what I think was) a
  work environment I wasn't a great cultural fit for, taking time off and
  resetting my emotional / mental state through a sabbatical, getting a job
  that I really like and finding my own voice, and most importantly going to
  psychotherapy and really getting some stuff off my chest. There's some stuff
  that seems bad, like the rest of 2020, but I think this year I've been
  climbing out of a deep hole I've dug for myself and it just seems like a
  part of the climb. It's also in large part due to the formation and
  maintenance of several key habits. I did use my habit tracker for at least
  the beginning of this year, and through [Boss as a
  Service](https://bossasaservice.life/) I submit daily affirmation emails
  that keep me repeating "I live in the best of all possible worlds.
  Everything I do today, I choose to do." explicitly, and I've created an
  hourly journal where I track every 15 minutes of my day so I know my time is
  being used productively.

  We'll see what happens during 2021, but I'm cautiously optimistic that I'll
  be able to keep up this tempo.

- **<span style="color:green">Make others happy (MEETS / EXCEEDS
  EXPECTATIONS)</span>**: I think I've helped a couple friends through some
  tough moments this year (e.g. a good number of friends from college are now
  in medical school, and starting your medical career during a pandemic is
  always stressful), and I like to think I've been a good friend. At least
  last year, I remember friends trying to support me and me being all
  emotionally flabby, and this year friends starting to deflate here and there
  and me being supportive and there for them. I think in large part, this
  change comes from me being able to love myself, and having this self-love
  radiate outwards towards others. Some friends have drifted further apart,
  but more friend groups than I expected have stayed in some capacity (e.g. a
  group of college friends gather every Wednesday evening, another friend
  group for professional development gathering on Telegram, etc). It's also
  beneficial when going into a new workspace and creating positive first
  impressions. I think this is very much a positive development, and I'd like
  to keep the good vibes going into next year.

- **<span style="color:green">Find joy in the ugliness of life (MEETS /
  EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS)</span>**: I think I've definitely succeeded in this
  regards, through some (I would say) relatively thorough planning ahead.
  After Trump won in 2016 I started stockpiling cash in my bank account like
  an insane man expecting things to go to shit at some point in time, and this
  was strengthened by my experience at my first company. So when 2020 finally
  hit, it was a liberating feeling of having been proven right and being ready
  (e.g. I had expected the government to completely botch a response to
  $SOME_BIG_BAD_EVENT and having no financial assistance for at least two
  years if not longer). With financials and social stuff taken care of, I
  could dedicate most if not all of my energy towards being happy and enjoying
  myself, which I could do because I had so deprived myself in years past the
  smallest things could spark joy. So I could micro-dose on natural endorphin
  / serotonin increases by doing things like getting takeout or eating meat in
  order to regulate my emotional state. It's not all scientific, and I expect
  that as 2020-like years becomes the new normal for life going forwards I
  would have to downscale some of these pleasures in order to maintain some of
  that balance, but I've found a great deal of success with my current
  approach. This, in addition to doing things like always reframing
  thoughts/sayings/actions in a positive manner, addressing stressors with my
  therapist and support network as they come along and nipping them in the
  bud, help keep the abyss at bay.

The "hard" (measurable) resolutions:

- **<span style="color:orange">Build the software products along my personal
  critical path towards personal improvement (PARTIALLY MEETS
  EXPECTATIONS)</span>**: So I didn't end up building the apps I wanted to
  build (the digital tele-Rolodex and the habit tracker), but I did end up
  building the "on-prem Firebase" proof-of-concept and gained a lot of skills
  there, plus learned a good deal of DevOps, and gained a lot by building out
  my own cooking website, ukulele progress tracker, and hourly journal (and
  email report tracker). This, in addition to other things like hoarding some
  mapping data in case society collapses and I need to find my family back in
  Michigan by walking from D.C. using an on-prem maptile server on my laptop.
  I think I'm well on my way to replacing the cloud-native, proprietary
  services I use with services I build and maintain myself.

  Next year, I might expect to build out e.g. my own photo gallery service
  syncing data to S3 (or S3 cold storage), my own spreadsheet app sitting on
  PostgreSQL, and maybe a smattering of other projects akin to
  https://tinyprojects.dev/.

- **<span style="color:green">Find a job that I like (MEETS / EXCEEDS
  EXPECTATIONS)</span>**: Finding my current place of employment was a
  **_huge_** relief off my chest. Before MotoRefi, I didn't think a good tech
  company in D.C. was possible, or that there were any good companies
  anywhere. Thank God for my fellow coworkers. I don't have to feel like I
  need to keep running, I don't have to uproot my life and go to some
  expensive tech hub in order to feel like I'm at the cutting edge, and I can
  learn things on the job as opposed to having to learn the wrong thing at
  work and then relearn the right thing after hours (I can actually relax!!).
  Thank God.

- **<span style="color:red">Get my first kiss (DOES NOT MEET
  EXPECTATIONS)</span>**: I did go on one virtual date (as opposed to five
  dates last year), but this wasn't something I ended up pushing hard towards,
  nor something that I felt was feasible this year. I'm not quite sure what my
  dating strategy will be going forwards, but I anticipate that it will become
  more and more ancillary to other priorities (e.g. speaking at a tech
  conference and meeting somebody there, going to an in-person sports league
  and meeting somebody, doing cooking classes or ukulele classes, etc). As
  long as I keep putting myself out there and don't shrink away from the
  world, that's as much as I can do.

In addition, some aggregate statistics I think help describe this year:

- Commits over the past 52-week period as of `2020-12-26T15:32:15.272282`: 3,957
  commits on GitHub from `2020/01/01`, and (2633 + 27 + 49 + 13 = 2722) on
  GitLab over four projects started this year for a total of **6,679** commits.
  I had originally wanted **10,000** commits but these things are just so easy
  to fudge (e.g. most of my commits are for my hourly journal, which are mostly
  one-liner changes).

- Books read: **21** as of `2020-12-26T15:57:14.766652` (and I'm not sure if
  I'll be stacking up these numbers at the end of the year like before so this
  should be a more or less accurate tally). I've heard that most CEOs read
  something like 50-60 books per year, and of course Warren Buffett reads
  something like 500 pages per day, and I'm not at that level yet. But I think
  there's a good mix of meaty subjects that change my worldview (like [Taleb's
  "Incerto" series](http://localhost:1313/posts/2020/04/09/the_black_swan/)),
  and fun books that I enjoy engaging with.

  What's surprising is that this tally is more than the **19** books I've read
  in 2019, when I thought I should have been reading more, though less than the
  **31** books I've read in 2018 and **29** books I've read in 2017. I think I
  only really tried in the first half of this year, otherwise I've been watching
  a good number of TV shows and such.

- I think this year I started using
  [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/dashboard), because I switched away
  from macOS to Ubuntu and lost the usage of
  [Timing.app](https://timingapp.com/?lang=en). In terms of statistics through
  RescueTime, as of `2020-12-31T13:58:37.200101`:

  - 1,113h on software development
  - 746h on utilities
  - 685h on entertainment
  - 379h on communication and scheduling
  - 161h on uncategorized

  Here's a picture of that report!

  [year_in_review](/img/posts/2020/12/31/year_in_review.png)

So, yeah. Overall, a pretty good year me. Actually better than most years.
Actually, fantastic, I think this is the best year I've had probably for the
last ten or fifteen years, by a significant margin. A large part of me hopes
every year is like 2020. But that's not nice for other people, and years change
anyways, so I wish instead I can keep riding this choo-choo train.
