I read [this
article](https://ktla.com/news/california/california-reports-record-number-of-daily-covid-19-infections-deaths/)
about how ICU capacity is now gone in Southern California. There are no more
hospitals for if you're sick. Given the circumstances, I made a late decision to
ask parents to not pick me up and drive me back from Virginia to Michigan, given
how a lot of people will be traveling this weekend for Christmas and rest stops
will see a lot of traffic. I really don't want to join the ranks of the infected
given how a vaccine is pretty much just around the corner.

It's hard keeping the faith (and I think at this point trust in science is a
kind of faith), so I started listening to some music.

GONNA BUILD A CASTLE
<br/>
GONNA BUILD IT HIGH
<br/>
GONNA BUILD IT BRICK BY BRICK
<br/>
AND STONE BY STONE
<br/>
TILL IT REACHES UP TO THE SKY
<br/>
WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN AND THE WIND GETS COLD
<br/>
WE'LL BE WARM INSIDE
<br/>
THE STORM WILL KEEP ON BREWING
<br/>
BUT WE'LL HAVE A PLACE TO HIDE
<br/>
<br/>
OH OH, THE VOICE DON'T LIE
<br/>
WE'RE GONNA BE SAFE AND SOUND TONIGHT
<br/>
OH OH, THE STRONG DON'T CRY
<br/>
GONNA OPEN UP THE DOOR
<br/>
WHEN THE MORNING LIGHT SHINES IN
<br/>
WHEN THE LIGHT SHINES IN
<br/>
<br/>
GONNA BUILD A PALACE
<br/>
GONNA BUILD IT GRAND
<br/>
GONNA BUILD IT FLOOR BY FLOOR
<br/>
AND WALL BY WALL
<br/>
WITH OUR HEARTS
<br/>
AND WITH OUR HANDS
<br/>
<br/>
WHEN WE STEP OUTSIDE INTO THE BREEZE
<br/>
WE'LL KNOW OUR COMMANDS
<br/>
WE'LL WALK INTO THE GARDEN
<br/>
AND WE'LL LIVE UPON THIS LAND
<br/>
<br/>
OH OH, THE VOICE DON'T LIE
<br/>
WE'RE GONNA BE SAFE AND SOUND TONIGHT
<br/>
OH OH, THE STRONG DON'T CRY
<br/>
GONNA OPEN UP THE DOOR
<br/>
WHEN THE MORNING LIGHT SHINES IN
<br/>
WHEN THE LIGHT SHINES IN
<br/>
<br/>
GONNA BUILD A FORTRESS
<br/>
GONNA BUILD IT STRONG
<br/>
GONNA BUILD IT BOLT BY BOLT
<br/>
AND PLATE BY PLATE
<br/>
GONNA BUILD IT ALL DAY LONG
<br/>
<br/>
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT THROUGH THE WINTER SNOW
<br/>
'CAUSE WE KNOW RIGHT FROM WRONG
<br/>
OUR HOUSE WILL STILL BE STANDING
<br/>
WHEN THE WORLD IS ALL BUT GONE

Nothing like some music from a violent death cult to keep you warm. That and
some cocoa.
