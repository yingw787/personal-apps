Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

Hmm, something new!

Bouncy little man.

So my investment in $LAZR is not doing so hot. Went up to $1500 gain, didn't
sell. Went down to $750 loss, still not selling. I think I'm gonna wait until I
at least break even, or two years for their go-to-market strategy to play out.

I think I stopped caring about that this weekend though, because I got sick. I
think it was the stomach flu from something I ate, maybe Chinese takeout, but I
managed to vomit a ton on Saturday just by drinking some water. It was horrible,
and made even worse by the thought I might have COVID. Other people said it's
probably not because I take the maximum amount of precautions I think anybody
can realistically take, but I didn't really believe that. I don't think the
virus cares what precautions you take if it manages to enter your system. I was
licking salt on the hour, just checking whether my taste buds were still
working. I also felt pretty murder-y, like I wanted to find the nearest Trump
supporter and strangle them with my bare hands. A healthy person wants a million
things. A sick person only wants one.

One nice thing I think I did was buy $100 worth of food for my friend working on
a COVID floor in a hospital. The restaurant even wrote little messages of "thank
you for your support" and stuff, which my friend conveyed via Messenger. Maybe
in my mind it was more transactional, like if I wanted a hospital bed I could
just say I was nice to one hospital worker and they'd give me one, rather than
just being super rich and connected. I think my friend appreciated it. I think a
lot of times I dance to the tune of my own drum. When everybody else was out on
the balconies cheering medical workers and stuff, I was like meh. Now everybody
is sick of COVID and I'm pitching in. I like to think I'm an anti-aliasing
function for good things.
