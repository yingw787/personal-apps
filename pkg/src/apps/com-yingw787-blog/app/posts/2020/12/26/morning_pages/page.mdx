Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

So smol.

Well I'm sad to say that I didn't escape 2020 intact. No, I don't think I have
COVID. But I did dun goof up my haircut:

I was trimming my hair making some final adjustments when I noticed a few stray
hairs near the back that needed trimming. Forgot that trimming hair where there
is a lot of hair requires using the lifting plastic thing or whatever. Stopped
after one buzz and then decided against a full buzz since that just isn't me,
and I need to look okay-ish at least in the front because still have meetings
and such.

You know that? I think I'll own it for now. I'm calling this cut the 2020
deluxe. It's a basic haircut with one giant fuckup somewhere.

I'm not too worried. I've never been too attached to my hair, or cutting hair.
It's head grass, I'm mowing my head grass and in 3-6 months it'll grow back
enough where I won't even notice it. And I'll cut it again then! But it is
interesting during a rather bland Christmas season.

Don't know why but I was pretty sick on Christmas Day that prevented some
traveling into the city that I wanted to do. Sitting upright, talking to a
friend online, and feeling like I wanted to vomit (again) is not how I expected
to spend Christmas in general. But I did manage to get a lot of sleep in the
afternoon, which somehow did not cut into my sleep time in the evening, so I
guess my body needed it.

Kind of crazy to believe that it's Saturday now. Feels like the holidays just
started, and work is on Monday. Eh. With how the holidays are going this year,
work might be a reprieve.
