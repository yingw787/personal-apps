Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

Apparently this is a momma cat and her kitten! But they'll always be kitties to
us hoomans.

I wonder if anybody else experiences these, but I think a few times now I've had
these weird dreams where something happens or somebody says something, and then
3-4 months later something happens that triggers that old memory. That garnered
a personal interest in recording pretty much everything I can remember from a
dream (or a nightmare more likes) into my sleep log notes, to see whether I can
backtrace something after it happens in real life.

...to be clear, I think this is more me being insane rather than claiming
pre-cognition being real. For example, I dreamt today that an acquaintance had a
severe case of cancer, and their significant other had to turn to creating and
running drugs in order to pay for health treatment. I was thinking about
purchasing a DVD boxed set of Breaking Bad before I went to bed, so this was
probably forward propagated from that. The acquaintance's significant other was
recorded on "TV" (in the dream) the phrase "everything you love can definitely
die". So I hope I don't hear that phrase for the next few months.

So I'm working on digitizing one tranche of my financial ledger, and holy hell
is it a slog. I don't get how people do data entry tasks for a living, it's so
dry. I guess that's why they're paid. I tried digitizing one budget and
expenditure sheet for one pay period, and it took around 30 minutes, and I have
three years worth of budgets and expenditures listed. Just have to keep at it
one step at a time, I guess. Hope I'll be able to get a year's worth of ledger
information out and into my on-prem digital financial ledger in time for my year
in review.
