Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

This video reminds me of one of those Asian cat statues you find in Asian
restaurants and stuff. Apparently it's called a
[Maneki-neko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneki-neko)?

You know on second thought I think this cat's just doing its own thing.

I think judging from my post history, this is the first time in a month or so
that I've gotten up on time. I don't know what made today so special, where I'd
sleep around 3:30AM and be able to get up and be productive today. It might be
because my phone died in the morning, or because I should text back some
friends. But I think the largest thing is building some modicum of discipline
back into my life again. I opened my windows in my bedroom to the rather brisk
October air, which forces me out of the bedroom. The bathroom windows also
forces me to brush my teeth really quickly unless I want to catch a cold, and
brushing my teeth prevents me from going back to bed, usually. Then being able
to see friends in the morning from Morning Poppins is also something to look
forward to. All this push and pull helped me get up. The problem is getting up
at the same time on a routine basis long enough to build a habit.

I discovered Chipotle has an app, _and_ they offer both pickup and delivery from
inside the app. I feel like I should have discovered this earlier on in the
pandemic.
