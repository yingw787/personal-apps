Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

Hmm, I do cute animal videos a lot of the time, maybe it's nice to do some cute
human videos.

If a golden retriever could be a productive human, it would be this kindergarden
teacher:

<video style="width: 100%; width: -moz-available; width: -webkit-fill-available; width: fill-available; max-width: 100%;" controls>
    <source src="/video/posts/2020/10/21/evening_pages.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
</video>
<br/>

This kid doesn't understand why his mom died inside (some swear words so watch at
your own discretion):

    <source src="/video/posts/2020/10/21/evening_pages_2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
</video>
<br/>
<br/>

Kinda wanted to jot down the videos before I forgot, but both videos made me
smile/laugh.

I committed to doing a technical presentation due in less than a week, so...I
should work on that at some point. It's 2 hours long, so it'll be a lott of
stuff.
