Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

Hmm, I do cute animal videos a lot of the time, maybe it's nice to do some cute
human videos.

If a golden retriever could be a productive human, it would be this kindergarden
teacher:

{/*<VideoPlayer
  sources={[
    {
      src: "/video/posts/2020/10/21/evening_pages.mp4",
      type: "video/mp4",
    },
  ]}
/>*/}

This kid doesn't understand why his mom died inside (some swear words so watch at
your own discretion):

{/*<VideoPlayer
  sources={[
    {
      src: "/video/posts/2020/10/21/evening_pages_2.mp4",
      type: "video/mp4",
    },
  ]}
/>*/}

Kinda wanted to jot down the videos before I forgot, but both videos made me
smile/laugh.

I committed to doing a technical presentation due in less than a week, so...I
should work on that at some point. It's 2 hours long, so it'll be a lott of
stuff.
