Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

Look at these nuggets!!

Well the President didn't die (which to be clear is a _good_ thing), so I'm glad
I'm not a betting man. On the other hand, one of my watermelons literally
distintegrated on the floor into a gigantic puddle of sugar water, and my
slippers at home are extremely sticky, so I guess that's fate's way of telling
me if I go looking for bad news it'll find me first.

In good news this week, today is the 2nd Saloniversary, and we're having a small
virtual party in honor of that. We're spending some time writing and the two
prompts we can choose from are "How have you changed this past year?" and "What
is a memory that will forever make you laugh out loud?"

Hmm, for the latter, I'd say watching "The Office", especially the early scenes.
Laughter is the best medicine, and it was really funny to laugh at a
dysfunctional office environment rather than internally screaming in one.

I think for the former, I've had to find some source of peace from within. I
think I've always relied on external stimuli for how I'm supposed to feel, and
that just doesn't work in 2020, but I think I've found that watching TV
(especially comedies) is a pretty relaxing way to spend time, and finding ways
in order to relax and make things and laugh is really important just over the
long term to reduce my cortisol levels. This year's also been weird in terms of
time, but I think it's hammered home how the days are long but the years are
short. Time feels pretty weird nowadays, but it always goes forward and you only
have so much, and that's why it's so important to keep track of where it's
going. This year's brought my hourly journal, and morning pages, and learning to
make my own popcorn on a stovetop. So you know what? Things aren't that bad.
