Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

A FLUFFY COW!!

I wonder how they maintain their coats, but this is somehow better than those
black cows I saw over in Taiwan.

I just realized yesterday that another week had gone by (...since last week) and
I didn't learn the song for ukelele I promised I'd learn yet. Luckily, I managed
to remember to ask for a week off before I start my new gig, and my manager
graciously said yes, so I have a week where I can choose to do anything. And
characteristically like me, I began stuffing it chock full of stuff I want to
do, which isn't all possible within one week.

I need to prioritize ukelele, so that I have something productive to reach
towards when I'm tired or bored or otherwise not working and awake. I think
that's one difference between that hobby and everything else. Reading books is
nice, and watching TV shows isn't bad, but it's very much a passive hobby that
doesn't really build hand-eye-brain coordination, and heaven knows I look at my
computer screen enough already.

I'm pretty excited to start my full-time gig. There's no lingering pits of
dread, no feeling like I got screwed, no desire to really keep searching (and if
I wanted to, I guess I could have), like that happened at my previous places. I
think if I wanted to, But I feel happy here, and that's a strange feeling. It's
a nice steady state I could get used to. I wonder if other happy people in the
world experience this for longer periods of time.
