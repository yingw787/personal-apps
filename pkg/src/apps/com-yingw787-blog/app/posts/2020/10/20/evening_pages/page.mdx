Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

I've been thinking about adopting a cat. Maybe it's because I'm looking to
convert to full-time instead of working on a contract basis (which has worked
out pretty nicely), but I think some stability can be good for long-term
planning. And that long-term planning might include adopting a pet. It
admittedly does get a bit lonely living by myself, and being under extended
lockdown I am feeling the "COVID fatigue" and venturing out more and more, which
ultimately will mean I'll get COVID if I don't stop. Best way to stop, might be
to have somebody to care for (and somebody who might miss me or the food I'll
give him/her if I get COVID to make me feel bad).

Some advice from a coworker? Anything that can be knocked down will be knocked
down, keep some empty shelves for them to jump on, and buy a squirt bottle (not
sure why). Should keep that in mind.
