I found this book (and a number of other older books) at Goodwill a few months
(or is it a year? I don't remember) ago, and I decided to get them. I'm a sucker
for military history, and the story of Operation Gothic Serpent is pretty much a
quagmire in a box, full of failures that future leaders may find important to
study.

The book itself is a very drawing read. By contrast, I purchased a bunch of
books on internal medicine, CNC machining, and woodworking, and those are still
sitting on my plastic table at home as I kept hanging onto this book. I think
one really nice thing about this book is how truthful the book appears. The
author went to great lengths in order to interview first-hand sources to what
actually happened, even going as far as flying to Mogadishu and interviewing the
Somalis there, and therefore it's not just another piece of propaganda but a
window into a real story.

I think it's kind of telling how the book is asking what the price is for
ignoring small brushfire conflicts around the world, back in the year 2000,
because the answer to that question came to our doorstep a year later.
