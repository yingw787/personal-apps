Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

Kitties on a tile floor!

Floor floofs. I like the way that sounds.

The presentation worked out rather smoothly! I thought it was going to blow up
in my face, but I managed to get enough content out the door where I didn't
embarrass myself. I do think I should have worried that I wasn't going to make
it, because I created the slides literally the hour before I gave the
presentation, but I didn't have to give a presentation for 1.5 hours (it was
intros + announcements + my presentation + Q&A + happy hour and my presentation
aspect took maybe 30-45m).

I think this is the first tech talk that I've given to a third-party group.
Maybe if I continue to give tech talks, I'll become better at speaking. I do
think without having this talk, I won't have the experience of using
property-based testing necessary for advocating for it authoritatively. Maybe I
should give a presentation on an app, and then create the app after feeling like
I can't back out of it.

I probably need to wrap up my learnings into a blog post. I have one partially
written already, but I didn't finish the coding samples and maybe having a
second party review it would be nice.

Fun fact: I had no idea how to paste code blocks in a good-looking manner into
Google Slides, and I thought I'd need to use something like Spectacle, which
would be an HTML/React-based presentation material. Instead, because VS Code's
interface is HTML (because it is an Electron app underneath the hood), I can
just straight up paste the code blocks from VS Code, set the highlight color to
transparent, and set the text color to black. It actually looks way better than
using a third-party formatter and pasting the text there.
