Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

I wonder if cats ever get tired of a move-y toy like this head scratcher.

I wouldn't, if I was a cat.

Oh my God I exercised today and found out I can't get through seven minutes of
exercise without running out of breath. I think I've been out of shape before,
but nothing as bad as this. I do feel good after working out, though; better
than I've felt in quite a while.

I've been a little afraid to get exercise this year, to be honest. If I fell and
sprained my arm, or broke a bone, or something stupid like that, I'd have to go
to the hospital...and yeah I don't want to do that right now, no matter what my
health insurance status looks like. Yet the counterbalance to that is is if I
don't exercise, then I suffer the slow death of being too fat and lazy. I think
I swung a little too hard in the latter direction.

I also need to do my laundry more often, and showering more often + making
dirtier laundry because I've been working out more often would be a good thing
IMHO. It's been my forcing function.

I've also been thinking about the weekly updates I wanted to make to my
technical blog. I stopped issuing them regularly after I started my
contract-to-hire role, and I've gotten so comfortable I let them fall by the
wayside. I think there's plenty of opportunity for me to learn + grow with this
company, but I think I need to be mindful that my career and learning
progression is my responsibility, and I should exercise my agency over that
fact.

So today I pinned [the 7-minute workout by New York
Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/well/workouts/) to my
Firefox pinned tabs. It's a webapp, and a damn good one too, which is super nice
for a Linux laptop, so hopefully that will help me keep up the workout. And the
feeling nice part, that was weird, but it felt good. Maybe that will help me
build a better habit.
