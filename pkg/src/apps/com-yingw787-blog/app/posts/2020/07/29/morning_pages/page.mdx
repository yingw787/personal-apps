Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

Ahh he can climb sideways!

I think this morning I'm feeling tired. I slept too late yesterday, and I woke
up automatically, nervous around the whole starting a new job thing. I think
it's a healthy change, I've been slacking off way too much recently, and I think
the job will give me some runway and some structure around my life. Maybe it's
natural in order to work for some period of time in an office. At least, working
feels natural to me.

I think about the past few months and the amount of effort I've spent trying to
get somewhere, anywhere really. I still need to start working on my habit
tracker. I still need to work on getting a digital Rolodex up and running and
populated. I still need to create a password autorotation tool (where none
currently exists, likely because not every client has an API and because
Bitwarden smartly doesn't expose an API for user data like that). I still need
to create the realtime data layer for event-driven clients. And I still need to
make my database-backed spreadsheet app. All things I need to do.

I also look at all the places I've failed at. I'm looking at my jobs spreadsheet
and realized that out of 30 or so jobs I've applied to, only one is currently
still active in the hiring process, otherwise I've been rejected out of hand or
ghosted without the courtesy of a response. It makes me wonder what the
correlation is between skill and success, and whether there is any. I kind of
always knew that where I'd end up and how well I'd do would be dependent on my
BATNA, and that companies look more for impact rather than raw intellect, but I
thought I'd be able to get somewhere with my sabbatical.

Then I remember I'm still incredibly lucky to be where I am. The job I'm
starting pays well and looks attractive from a skills learning standpoint. My
coworkers seem nice and considerate. The company was polite enough to put my
one-off requests in writing. Where else would I be able to have that kind of
flexibility?

No, I'm not bitter, I'm grateful. I have to be grateful. It's up to me to prove
I'm worth it.
