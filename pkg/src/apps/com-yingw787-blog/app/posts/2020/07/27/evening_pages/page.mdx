Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

I start a new job on Wednesday! This time around, I'm trying a contract-to-hire
agreement. A bit unconventional, but I think it might be a better way to de-risk
the hiring process by learning more about the company and the people dynamics
within, and there's an explicit fit check at the end where if either party is
dissatisfied, we can walk away entirely, no harm no foul.

I honestly have a good amount of work to do to hold up my end of the bargain.
I've been sleeping too late and waking too late (hence the far more intermittent
Morning Poppins posts), and I'm a bit afraid I won't start off well. I also have
to review a good number of technologies and read through a good amount of
documentation between now and Wednesday morning. I'm hoping that besides the
additional financial cushion and the opportunity to work on a codebase with
other people, the contract-to-hire agreement will give me a chance to set my
life in order (again), so that I can continue working on my own apps and see
whether that goes anywhere.

I think with the whole pandemic, I had prototyped two approaches: try to brace
against the storm, or learn to ride it. I think I'm learning to ride it, which
to me is much more preferable than trying to brace against it. Embracing
uncertainty and chaos as a way of life means much less fear of the sudden
layoff, the sudden cancer diagnosis, and otherwise the all-engulfing Black Swan.
