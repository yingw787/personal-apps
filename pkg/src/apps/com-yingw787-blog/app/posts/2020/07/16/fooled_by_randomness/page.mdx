This is the third book I've read from Professor Taleb's "Incerto" series. I
think the entire series does consistently hammer home the same points from
different angles. Professor Taleb builds on the lessons of uncertainty taught in
["The Black Swan"](/posts/2020/04/09/the_black_swan) and the need to protect
against it in ["Antifragile"](/posts/2020/05/06/antifragile), with the
perspective of how Black Swans don't swim in a calm, still pond. Rather, that
pond is rather loud, dark, and might even have a few turbulent undercurrents
coming in from a strid or something. That's why people don't see Black Swans
until it's too late, and it's why structuring your life to be antifragile works
in more situations than you may predict.

There's three lessons I took away from this book:

- **Events in "higher-order" matters like finance, economics, and business are
  highly epistemic.** Professor Taleb makes much of quants who believe too
  much in connecting economic theory with market dynamics, and who
  consequently lost everything and got thrown out of their companies. There
  _is_ no all-encompassing economic theory -- the more complicated a theory
  is, the more likely it'll be caught by the next Black Swan. For these kinds
  of fields, you only know what you know, extrapolate at your own risk.
  Therefore, always put stop losses on your bets, both in trading and in life,
  in order to de-risk any downsides. Also, keep your theorems simple;
  Professor Taleb recommends using a "Monte Carlo toy" in order to run
  probabilistic simulations of any given bet.

- **Non-linearities remain pervasive.** On pg. 173, Professor Taleb mentions
  building a sandcastle higher and higher, until it collapses. Ultimately,
  this collapse can be rooted to placing one more grain of sand in the wrong
  place, a linear action that caused a non-linear reaction. Yet the material
  difference between that grain of sand and any other grain of sand is small,
  if existent. Any grain of sand, including those placed previously, could
  have caused the tower to fall. Therefore, it is impossible to know which
  single grain of sand caused the collapse, and impossible to protect yourself
  from said grain of sand. You could say something similar for the specific
  trade that caused the 2008 recession, or the specific animal that caused the
  current coronavirus pandemic.

- **People choose between a satisficing or maximizing outcomes.** On pg. 258,
  Professor Taleb mentions how randomness prevents optimization (and
  especially over-optimization), and how that forces people to slow down and
  take things easy. He mentions how it's impossible to tell when the NYC MTA
  arrives at a given station, so the best you can do is plan a buffer, do your
  thing, and not worry about it. This may improve quality of life, since human
  beings lived in highly stochastic situations for thousands of years, and a
  satisficing approach better respects our encoded habits and instincts.
