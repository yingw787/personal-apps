Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

I finally got up before 11:00AM, for the first time in like two weeks! I'm
pretty pleased with myself.

One full week of doing whatever I want, before moving onto the next contract.
And by doing whatever I want, hopefully that includes getting stuff shipped for
Paint Creek Software / FormDeploy / TinyDev. Weird how setting lower
expectations gives higher productivity. Never ceases to fascinate.
