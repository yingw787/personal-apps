Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

Stealthy!

Hidden kitten mittens. I like the way that sounds and I like the way that reads.

I think it's the Fourth of July this weekend. Apparently it's a long weekend for
most people. I don't think I'm doing anything personally, only special thing
might be that I'm planning on making meatball soup with my mom.

It is interesting that this year, we make our own freedom. For me, that freedom
comes from thinking. That world from "Ready Player One", where everything is
done in virtual reality, doesn't look so bad after all. Think a certain way, and
maybe doors will open for you.
