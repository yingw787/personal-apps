Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

Need I say more?

Yesterday went well! I stayed productive, my coworkers are really cool, and the
tech seems a few grades up from what I'm used to. I'm also pretty happy that I
have some discipline in my schedule again. I just need to remember to
relax...and practice relaxing during the week...and that life's a marathon and
not a sprint.

I did start watching "Parks and Recreation" yesterday. Leslie Knope is kind of
like Michael Scott, but a little less funny. The first season isn't bad so far,
we'll see how the rest of the show progresses.

I'm not sure how much I'll be using "The Office" DVD set and the DVD player I
purchased. I need to take a look at `handbrake-gtk` to copy over the DVDs to my
laptop, but I'm not sure if the DVDs have copy protection enabled on them. I
don't think I'd return them if they did, I'd probably keep them just as a backup
set of discs in case there's no Internet or something and I want to just watch
something I forgot to store on my laptop.

Which reminds me, apparently my Virginia apartment lost Internet for a few days.
I hope the apartment is still there. If it burned down I think I'd miss my books
the most, there's like $1000 in books I've purchased and curated in my personal
library. I'm really glad I didn't furnish my apartment, less stuff to lose.

I'm also running out of storage space on my laptop. Due to `node_modules` from
JavaScript / Node projects. That's pretty insane innit? Every major project I'm
working on how has 1GB or more's worth of `node_modules`. I mean, what works
works, but at the same time Python doesn't do this. I need to purchase more
laptop storage.
