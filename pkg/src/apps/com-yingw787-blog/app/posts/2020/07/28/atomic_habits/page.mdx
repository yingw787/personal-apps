Learning about habits isn't anything new to me, but what impressed me about
Clear's book is how well it ties together emotion and identity with a variety of
different approaches to developing good habits / breaking bad ones into a
comprehensive life improvement platform. Clear asserts that habits are only
formed when we desire a change to our identity, and when we consistently tie our
actions to that identity change. It's definitely a step above a usual
"life-hack" book, or at least a lot of what the book stated early on resonated
with me.

I think this book would come really useful when I build out my own habit
tracker.
