Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

What a noble sphinx! Dog's cool too.

I think with the first fall frosts (which came pretty late this year, didn't
drop below the 70s until mid-November), I think I'm slowly starting to realize
that 2020 is almost over. WHAT A YEAR! January feels like such a long time ago,
and yet the year still passed...rather quickly. I mean, I can still remember
January, at least, and my memory's not all that great.

It's crazy that even through the craziness, the truth of "the days are long, but
the years are short" still rings true. Soon I'll be typing up another year of
metrics and reflections and all that good stuff. I remember from one movie,
something about a Roman general marching to Rome during the late Roman Empire
when the Vandals or Visigoths were sacking the city, said "The ground is still
beneath us and the sky is still above us", and I think it's a good way to keep
one's sanity.

I think the time of long snows has kind of come to an end, and I think I'm a bit
sad about that. Snow only exists in my memories now, and I think a whole bunch
of memories will soon be like that. I think over the years, that's the one
regret over the passage of time. Years come again and again. So do days. But
never time.
