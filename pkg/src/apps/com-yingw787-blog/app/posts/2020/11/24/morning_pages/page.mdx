Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

Woooooo Washingtonian!

Smack-dab center is Ali talking about Morning Poppins! Apparently people meet at
hairdressers.

Also some baby chickens!

You know I just remembered this week contained Turkey Day...so let's think of
this as preserving chickens by eating turkeys and ignore the drumsticks in my
hands.

So I picked up some Trader Joe's kettle-brewed concentrated green and white tea,
a gallon of it. And I drank half of it yesterday. I drank about half a gallon of
tea in 30 minutes. Very watery, did not know why I wasn't really feeling awake.
Today I woke up and I was _wired_. I'm like
idontwanttostayinbedbecausethennothinghappensiwannagetupandjumparound kind of
wired. I think this kind of destabilizer (if you can call it that) is useful in
some cases, like trying to wake up early or resetting my schedule. But overall I
think it's a bad habit because it's not like I can drink this much caffeine for
much longer and come out the other end fine. I'll take it as it comes. Just have
to keep in mind that tasting like water does not mean it has no effect. Bottled
tea is just a caffiene time bomb.

Oh man, am I excited for a three day week! I don't think I could have picked a
better time to convert from part-time to full-time, because all the holidays
sprinkled throughout these last two months makes it easier to feel like I'm
still part-time. I don't know what I'll be doing for Thanksgiving. It might be
nice to cook something big by myself (and for myself since I'll just be
celebrating by myself). Or maybe I'll just read my books and try some new
restaurants. Don't think there's a wrong answer there.
