Well, the day is here. It feels like the anti-Christmas, you know? Like you have
a bunch of presents like clean water and fresh food and the ability to walk from
one side of town to the other without getting shot, and now all these presents
are taken by the anti-Santa who steals them from underneath the tree, shimmys
back up the chimney, and takes them to the North Pole where he drops it into the
icy bottom of the Arctic Ocean so that nobody can have them because anti-Santa
is an evil git.

Sigh. It's still pretty hard getting people to vote, and to vote for democracy.
Hearing people around me say the election just doesn't matter to them and
whoever is in power nothing will change and that democracy isn't all that great
and too much freedom is a bad thing kinda gets to you, especially after seeing
the state of Georgetown yesterday. I mean...yeah I guess the past four years
haven't been bad for me personally, I think I've grown a lot and so has my bank
account. But I don't exist in a vacuum. There's so many other people whose jobs
I couldn't do myself, carpenters, electricians, farmers, soldiers, garbage
workers, etc. I directly depend on, and that's separate from things like
regulators to keep food fresh and air clean, and yada yada yada. I think while
it may have been true four years ago who gets elected doesn't matter all that
much, it's not true now. It was also an asshole thing to say even then.

Again, there's no reason to just have a bundle of anxiety you don't know what to
do with. Better to relieve it somehow, preferably in productive ways, hence
writing and meditating and such.
