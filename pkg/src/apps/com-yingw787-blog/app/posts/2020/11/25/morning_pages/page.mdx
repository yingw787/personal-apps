Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

Panda eating bamboo!

Kind of reminds me of eating ice cream.

So a day after drinking a half gallon of concentrated brewed tea, I drank
another half gallon of concentrated brewed tea. So I'm up and at 'em again
today. So glad that this week's Thanksgiving. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to
keep up this tempo without my heart exploding. Hopefully, it's a trigger to
leading a healthier balance in life.

I'm not quite sure what I'm going to do in order to celebrate Thanksgiving. It
kind of feels weird to give thanks during this year, probably because this
year's just so weird. But there is plentyyyy to give thanks for. Staying
healthy. Being happy. Being alive. I've heard that a healthy person wants a
million things, while a sick person only wants one. I'm not sure if I only want
one thing this year, but I think my interests have narrowed quite a bit.
