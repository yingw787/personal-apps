So adorable! Wish everybody could be like this. Reminds me of preschool naptime.

Hmm, trying to think about anything else to talk about besides the election or
the upcoming civil war. My time management practices are pretty bad. I have the
week off, but I think I should come into work today because I had promised I
would finish this one thing, and I kind of didn't do anything on Saturday to fix
that. Sunday I got a bit luckier, and was able to finish some amount of work,
but otherwise I have this biological inability to do a whole lot during the
weekends.

I would like to think this is a good thing, especially if I'm trying to settle
into life and my own skin, but I still have an extremely difficult time relaxing
in what should be my "days off". And it's difficult to accept because there's
always going to be more work, there's always going to be unfinished tasks. I
hope that I'm just wanting to finish this work now because I had badly
underestimated how much time it would otherwise take, and it's a one-time deal
that will be less and less frequent the more and more familiar I am with the
systems I'm working with.

So, I have a week off. What am I going to do with this time?

- I promised my friend that I'd learn ukelele. I think I need to stick to this
  promise because I had pushed my deadline to learn the songs we were going to
  play together twice already.

- I also need to exercise each day. It would be great to do some seven-minute
  workouts at home, for starters. Should be very low-risk for injury, and push
  the boundaries that have been closing in after not doing a whole lot of
  exercising in the first place.

- Read+work through "Hands on Scala" and problem statements.

- Read through "The Serverless Stack" guide on building serverless applications
  on AWS. I think I discounted serverless heavily during my sabbatical because I
  wanted to learn stuff that would stick, and while I managed to do that to an
  extent, I think this stuff would give me the final push to creating
  production-grade apps I'm confident about.

- Publish commitment to work on FlooFoo (or maybe sign up on a podcast from Bob
  or something) and hope to make enough progress on it where I can publish a
  post to "Ask HN" and get some initial traction. Then continue working on it
  during the weekends and evenings.

That should be plentyyyyyyy to distract me from the world, if I want to be
distracted. Otherwise, I should work through House M.D. and see whether season 5
is as good as I've heard.
