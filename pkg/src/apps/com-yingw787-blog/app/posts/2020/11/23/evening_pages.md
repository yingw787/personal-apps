Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

The elections are certified! Cat's in the bag, bag's in the river. Hopefully
I'll never have to even think about politics like this again. I know I just
jinxed everybody. It's what I do.

I think Jon's idea of spending some money in order to feel a bit better about
myself kinda works. Before, I think I would have been extremely afraid of even
spending money. But this past weekend I bought a burger and some lo mein, and
even though my arteries feel a bit clogged and I need to exercise, I feel like I
can enjoy some small things again. This kind of reminds me when I got my plant
back in college. I told the botanist I didn't see butterflies or something until
pretty late in my life, and she kind of just paused and stared at me and asked
whether I was deprived as a child. Gotta love botanists, they go straight to the
point. Or the jugular. Maybe they're the same thing. Nice thing about being
deprived is that even small things can bring a lot of joy. Since people easily
get used to their environments, if you surround yourself with wealth and
prosperity you start thinking you deserve it and it'll always be there. If you
surround yourself with Poland and potatoes you start appreciating salt and
pepper and other condiments.

I still need to get an electric bike. Have no idea what the ship date looks like
on a default Carbo Model X, but it's a pretty nice-looking bike, and pretty
cheap for the functionality it packs in too.
