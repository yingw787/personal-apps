Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

A 15-minute old lamb! Ahhhhhhhhh

Might be relevant with December and Christmas and mentionings of lambs going up.

I got my Series 5 Apple Watch today! It's not a bad piece of hardware. Charging
cable could be a bit longer. Also got a microphone set from company I work for!
It's a really nice setup, and I could definitely get used to this. I'm a little
concerned about having a bunch of stuff...but when I look at it, I don't think I
purchase anything I don't need in some way.

I guess it could be that I _need_ it because I put myself in a position to need
it. I have a whole bunch of stuff I purchased because I set up my home office a
few years ago requiring a bunch of cables. I purchased a laptop that doesn't
have a whole lot of ports. I have to purchase a USB hub in order to funnel all
that data into said ports. I have to get a larger desk in order to place things
on. Blah blah blah.

Something to manage, add it on the pile, but I think I'm starting to feel a bit
less guilty about purchasing things overall. I think I've kind of deprived
myself a bit over the years, and I think it's healthy in order to spend money to
achieve a slightly higher quality of life. If what happened before made me more
miserable, maybe this new path will be better. We'll see what happens.
