It's nice to have a little bit of certainty.

Holy hell that's a large font.

And to highlight my bad timing skills. Or Firefox being really laggy on my
computer.

I think there's some important caveats to note:

- **Without the Senate, there won't be a whole lot that'll get done.** There's
  enough to be fixed for four year's of work, sure, but they'll just get
  reversed with the next Donald Trump (Tom Cotton or Josh Hawley are my betting
  favorites to continue Trumpism, and maybe go in an even more extreme
  direction). You'll need Congress in order to pass laws that are much more
  resilient to being chipped away.

  I can't believe the ACA is still standing after all these years, but if you
  think about it, the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 was only repealed in 1864,
  after the Emancipation Proclamation of 1862. It was easier to go to civil war
  than it was to repeal that law. So maybe it shouldn't be that surprising.

  I donated $100 each to Jon Ossoff and Reverend Raphael Warnock, because both
  races are close enough to go to runoff (thank you Stacey Abrams) and those
  races will decide control for the U.S. Senate. Mitch McConnell has already
  declared he will blockade anything Biden does, and I don't want to hear about
  him again for four years, so money toss. I don't know what Warnock's chances
  are because he's a black man running against a reasonably hot blonde (even
  though she can't even be corrupt correctly), but Ossoff seems competitive.
  We'll see what happens.

- **No presidential candidate has a mandate.** The country is almost as evenly
  divided as it was four years ago. Races are being decided on margins of tens
  of thousands of votes in multiple states. Philadelphia had armed miltiamen
  patrolling near polling stations and bomb threats called in to slow the count.
  No matter which side had won the presidency, the other would be implacably
  hostile towards it. That doesn't bode well for the Union.

  I think voting rights and urban/rural partnership initiatives could help lower
  the temperature and create more jobs in small to mid-size cities, and I think
  the party in power should communicate more about its initiatives. People
  shamed President Trump for sending that letter with the one-time direct
  payment stimulus, but honestly I thought it was refreshing to hear directly
  from the government, even if it was a bit campaign-y. I hope Biden writes to
  people about green jobs and stuff he's doing, because people only tune in to
  certain sources in the media while the mail arrives for mostly everybody.
  Great way to check whether the USPS is still working, too.

- **Turnout has to be an active process.** You can't just blare out "a wildfire
  burned down your city and the POTUS is refusing to send assistance" and expect
  people to vote for the other party. Maybe in saner times you can, but the path
  that works is shown in Georgia, where Abrams went door to door registering
  hundreds of thousands of people to turn out for the vote. It's like
  counter-insurgency operations, you can't just go in with air support, you have
  to have boots on the ground and make sure the locals support you.

Biden is in an extremely weak position coming into POTUS. He has to run a
disparate coalition, held together by the singular hatred of the current POTUS.
The current POTUS by contrast can call upon a cult, the unthinking greedy, and
foreign interests in order to execute policy. There's a very real chance Biden
will just warm the seat until a red tide comes in 2022 and 2024.

I don't know what the next four years are going to bring, but I think I'd like
to get more involved, and go to town halls and demand answers from
representatives and stuff. I'm personally skeptical of myself wielding any sort
of power beyond deciding what bagels to get for a meeting, but I think people
will easily forget "the year that will never be forgotten" and it'll take people
who remember applying consistent pressure over decades in order to effect policy
correctly.

I think we've have had precious little to celebrate on the federal front over
the past four years. And I don't begrudge people from celebrating. But we have
125,000 coronavirus cases yesterday, up from 80,000 last Friday, with a 50%
positivity rate in some cities and states, and Trump cult members praying over
election results in Nevada (that have already been written down) in front of the
polling station. And now with Biden's victory, Democrats have lost their biggest
(and perhaps only) reason to turn out for elections at all. So while others may
celebrate Joe Biden's win, I'm not celebrating until the next Donald Trump
loses. I might be waiting a while. A very very very long while.
