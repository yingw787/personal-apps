I went out to D.C. for the first time since this past Tuesday, and I think the
past four years kind of just hit me like a sack of bricks. I definitely felt the
urge to scream "WE ARE FREE" at the top of my lungs and maybe get arrested for
insanity. Instead I stared at a Biden supporter for five seconds and then gave a
small thumbs up, then waved at another Biden supporter who ignored me.

There's some small things I'm a little worried about. [The head of the National
Nuclear Security Administration was fired two days
ago](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/524865-lisa-e-gordon-hagerty-resigns-as-nnsa-administrator),
and there's 84 unaccounted for Soviet briefcase nukes that have no Permissive
Action Links. Pretty sure it's routine for the Trump administration to kick over
tables though, and he doesn't seem the type to plot things as big as nuking D.C.
on his way out and succeed, and no organization or country would be insane
enough to nuke D.C. and not expect a response with an incoming administration.
If it happens though, I should be well within the blast radius so hopefully
that'll be a quick death. So meh. Celebration time!

I think today I was reminded of "Wildflowers" by Tom Petty, the song played when
Ann Perkins left Pawnee, Indiana in "Parks and Rec".

So much nicer than the Civil War music I listened on repeat during the past few
months.

It inspired me to maybe write a little poetry, about freedom and how nice it is
to be masters of our own fate. Here it is.

<div style="color: black; text-align: center; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; padding: 20px; width: 100%">
  O FREEDOM!
  <br />
  HOW WE HAVE THIRSTED!
  <br />
  THE ELIXIR OF OUR LIVES
  <br />
  AS FRESH AS MOUNTAIN STREAMS
  <br />
  AS LUSH AS SPRING MEADOWS
  <br />
  WHEN OUR MOUTHS DRY
  <br />
  ONLY YOUR TASTE QUENCHES!
  <br />
  <br />
  O FREEDOM!
  <br />
  HOW WE HAVE HUNGERED!
  <br />
  MANNA OF OUR HEARTS
  <br />
  AS SOFT AS RIPE MANGOES
  <br />
  AS CRISP AS ORCHARD APPLES
  <br />
  ONLY YOUR MEAL FILLS!
  <br />
  <br />
  O FREEDOM!
  <br />
  HOW WE HAVE LONGED FOR YOU
  <br />
  HOW WE HAVE CRIED FOR YOU
  <br />
  HOW WE HAVE RAN TO YOU
  <br />
  AS PRECIOUS AS THE AIR WE BREATHE
  <br />
  AS DEAR AS THE CHILDREN WE CARRY
  <br />
  OH HOW WE CLING TO YOU NOW!
  <br />
  <br />
  O FREEDOM!
  <br />
  WE WILL HONOR YOUR NAME
  <br />
  THIS WISH OF WASHINGTON
  <br />
  THIS LABOR OF LINCOLN
  <br />
  WE BEAR THIS PRECIOUS GIFT
  <br />
  WE HOLD YOUR TORCH HIGH
  <br />
  WE PRAISE YOUR NAME
  <br />
  AS THE BLOOD RUNS IN OUR VEINS
  <br />
  AS OUR FLESH WALKS THIS EARTH
  <br />
  WE WILL NEVER YOU GO!
