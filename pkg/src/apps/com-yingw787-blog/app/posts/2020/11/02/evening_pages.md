I went on the longest walk I've been on this year tonight. Went from my
apartment over in Ballston, to Georgetown and the waterfront. Seeing the
neighborhood boarded up again really sucks. About a third to a half of the
stores are boarded up, and laborers are still working throughout the night.
Guess they wanted to squeeze out as much revenue as they could by keeping the
windows open until the end. You can kind of tell who still has money after this
year, because it's the larger stores boarding themselves up while the smaller
stores still have all their windows. I'm guessing they don't have enough money
to board up anymore. About a fifth of the stores just aren't there anymore, they
went under this year. I never knew. A lot of real estate going up for sale.

Have no idea what tomorrow is going to look like. I wonder if the water and
electricity will be cut. Maybe I should go buy another tall kitchen bin and some
iodine tablets. My GI tract would probably be unused to it though.

Sigh. Hopefully nothing will happen. And it doesn't really do to worry anyways.
I should probably just continue to focus on what I can control. If something
does happen though, it was nice to see the entire city lit up from the Key
bridge. One last time.
