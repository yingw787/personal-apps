My life right now.

Well, that was stressful and anti-climatic.

I really should stop worrying about political stuff, it's like a car crash you
can't look away from. What I should appreciate is how my county voted 85/15, and
it's really nice to be able to trust your neighbors to distinguish between right
and wrong. Or the cynic in me is right and people are voting against Trump / for
Biden because they're government employees who don't want the size of the
federal government to decrease.

The craziest stories from yesterday were the delays in counting ballots due to
the small things. Like, apparently Georgia is in play right now (...?!!) and the
polling station in Atlanta had to stop counting for a while in the morning
because a water pipe burst. I'm sitting here thinking, _I really hope this
doesn't change anything because if we start a civil war because of a pipe burst
that'd be the dumbest way to die in human history_. Luckily, I think I'm just
being a bit dramatic. People are kind of just waiting around for the results,
and nobody really wants to fire the cannon into Fort Sumter this time around
because it didn't work out.

In terms of getting back to where we were in '08, or '92, yeah that's done. This
isn't the old America anymore, it's a new one where you can [accuse your
opponent of trafficking children and threaten their
lives](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/10/17/kevin-van-ausdal-qanon-marjorie-greene-georgia/?arc404=true)
and [cruise to victory after he
withdraws](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/11/04/marjorie-greene-qanon-georgia-congress-election/).
It looks like America won't end tonight. Maybe in a few more years.
