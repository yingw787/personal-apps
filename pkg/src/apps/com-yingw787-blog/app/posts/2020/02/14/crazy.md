I was on the livestream for "The State of Independent Saas" by Rob Walling and
MicroConf, and Jason Fried of Basecamp (whose company helped sponsor the report)
offered to send a free copy of his and David's new book to anybody who emailed
him. So I sent an email and he graciously forwarded a copy of his new book!!
It's definitely nice to read something short and sweet after my last book.

I've purchased, read, and reviewed two others books by the same authors:
[Rework](/posts/2018/04/04/rework) and [Remote](/posts/2018/05/23/remote). This
book is very much in the same vein. Being calm and sane is both possible and not
a bad thing to want. Once upon a time, I thought repeating yourself was a bad
thing. In fact, [don't repeat
yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) is a software
principle, one I like quite a bit. But when it comes to cultural or
psychological shifts, I've found hammering the same message again and again
helps it stick better -- especially when so many others espouse the exact
opposite.

Jason and David pointed out three things I thought could use more mentioning:

- **Leadership is fraught.** You'll never get your reports to completely trust
  you, because of the imbalanced power dynamics. Accept that. Your every word,
  even a recommendation, trickles down as a command. Accept that too.
  Leadership isn't about seeing eye to eye on everything, it's about how best
  to build alignment and move forward. I find these truths hard and cold, but
  they're truths nonetheless, and the faster one adapts to them, the better a
  leader they can be.

- **Mentally reframing certain challenges helps to build the culture you
  want.** "Whatever it takes" becomes less so when you find you don't have a
  blank check to spend or unlimited time to execute, and asking that question
  "what is my resource allocation" makes the constraints come into view (which
  helps in linearizing priorities). Adding "do nothing" to the list of options
  puts the possibility that doing something might make things worse.

- **Change and stability are mindsets.** Jason and David explicitly say that
  their practice of "calm" works for them because they've tried other ways to
  do things. That resonated with me, as a guy who always does things the hard
  way, and it makes me feel good that I'm not entirely alone in this way of
  thinking. Iterate until you feel good. Then rest.
