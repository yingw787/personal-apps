I just feel like I have a lot to get off my chest today for some reason. I'm
terrified that [the project I'm working on now](https://tinydevcrm.com) won't
ever get off the ground. I'm terrified of looking the people who trusted me in
the eye and telling them I let them down -- again. I think I'm probably afraid
of my own shadow at this point.

So much unchecked fear, swirling like a brine lake in front of my eyes, inside
my head, day after day, year after year. Thinking myself into some kind of a
rampant state.

Well, no more. This is turning out to be the year I'm ripping the Band-Aids off.
The real question is, if you've applied a Band-Aid to a gunshot off, does
ripping off the Band-Aid mean you'll bleed to death?
