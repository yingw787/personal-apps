Two weekends ago, I flew from D.C. to Chicago in order to see a play: [Baked!
The Musical](https://www.bakedthemusical.com/).

![logo](/img/posts/2020/02/17/following_through_1.png)

It's co-produced by my good friend from high school, [Jordan
Liu](https://blog.jminjie.com/). I'm so happy I went. It's clear he and his
co-producer best friend [Deepak Kumar](https://kumarde.com/) put in a lot of
effort and hard work into making the play as polished and complete as it was.
The show was wonderful, hilarious and emotional and thought-provoking, assembled
with many genius brushstrokes. Apparently, the play sold out of its original run
of shows and tickets, and the theatre had to book more sessions because it was
so popular, which is a really good problem to have (or at least a better problem
than "we can't fill seats").

Chicago was great too! It was the first time I've visited since elementary
school, when I went up the Sears Tower and was too afraid to look down the glass
floor. Chicago has that "big city" feel, with the supertall skyscrapers that you
_know_ are really tall, but are far away enough where you get the "it's not that
tall" feeling -- like the Rocky Mountains:

> Oh look, the Rocky Mountains. Don't worry kids, we'll be there in no time,
> they look so big already!
>
> (five hours later)
>
> Why are they the **exact** same size??

I got the same feeling when I was on the Staten Island Ferry and looking towards
lower Manhattan. But unlike New York City, Chicago felt far more comfortable.
For one, I really like the CTA, I liked it better than MTA or BART and maybe
even my own beloved WMATA (apparently this point might be contested amongst my
friends). Chicago's people also seemed friendlier and chiller, while New Yorkers
were constantly busy and angry and flowing in the streets like worker bees.
Chicago also has wider streets, with canals intersecting the city. And it was
cold, really cold, and I _love_ the cold! I'm constantly terrified of never
seeing snow ever again, and it snowed while I was there. To put that into
perspective, Michigan measured 60 degrees Fahrenheit during December, the same
place where it used to snow six inches every winter without fail just ten years
ago. Crazily enough, Chicago felt more like home than home itself felt.

It was kind of crazy going to Chicago. I'm on sabbatical at the moment and it's
not like I'm rolling in money. If United Basic Economy round-trip tickets
weren't $100, I doubt I would have pulled the trigger. It's also crazy [for
other reasons as well](/posts/2020/01/20/on_failure), that I don't really want
to elaborate on here. But the absolute craziest thing about the trip was, _I
almost didn't make it in the first place_.

Sometimes, I over-promise and under-deliver. In the past, this used to be "all
the time". I'd always bite off more than I can chew, and end up overworking, and
still falling short of my original commitments. So when Jordan said he was
hosting a play, and I decided to purchase tickets online, I mentioned I might be
coming. Our conversation went something like this:

> Me: I purchased a ticket to your play! Hopefully I can make it to Chicago!
>
> Jordan: I hope you can make it too!

Jordan didn't say anything untoward or hint towards anything negative, but I got
a sinking feeling in my stomach that I was always the friend who never showed
up, always the friend who was never there. I mean, when _was_ the last time I
traveled domestically to see a friend? _Never_. I've never even flown in order
to see a friend, because I always valued saving money, and having that temporary
feeling of comfort and safety in having just a little more financial freedom.

And what did it cost me? The risk of one of the five regrets appearing when I'm
still in my 20s. Which is absolutely and completely ridiculous!! I'm not
married, I don't have kids, I'm not tied down in any way, shape, or form, and
yet I feel a lot more alone and trapped on a regular basis than I really should
(whether I'm on sabbatical or working a job).

So I decided to do something different. I recognized that I did feel bad about
not showing up, and honestly a bit pissed off at myself that I let things come
to this. So I purchased the ticket and didn't hesitate (too much) on making the
decision.

I mean, _come on_. It's \$100. Other friends, friends who have started companies,
friends who interview at med school or residencies, spend tens of thousands of
dollars on traveling, and travel cross-country every week. If I can't make \$100
in an hour after going back to work, what kind of a software engineer am I even?

Jordan was delighted that I would be flying in! I made a friend happy, and that
made the two months in between really happy for me :smile:
