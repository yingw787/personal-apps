I donated a total of $250, to Planned Parenthood, the American Heart Foundation, and the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention. They all got 4 stars on [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/), and they all relate to causes I believe in (planning out your life, not having heart trouble, and not killing yourself). It kind of seems like I'm pissing into the wind sometimes, though. Maybe a little piss in every direction will have some effect and benefit people.

In other news, apparently a human life is only worth between 2-8 million dollars. Seems kinda low. One day, I hope to have rich enough to donate that amount without going backrupt.
