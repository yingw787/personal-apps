import { ArticleLayout } from "@libs/blog/components/article-layout";

export const article = {
  author: "Ying Wang",
  date: "2017-05-13",
  title: "Remaining Todos",
  description: "Remaining Todos",
  categories: ["Others"],
};

export const metadata = {
  title: article.title,
  description: article.description,
};

export default (props) => (
  <ArticleLayout article={article} theme="solarized" {...props} />
);

So far I have listed (publicly and privately) the following remaining todos:

- Support for markdown-it-katex
- Support for js-sequence-diagrams
- Mobile friendliness
- Routes for individual posts
- Metadata for each individual post using markdown-it-meta or similar
- Centering images
- Pagination
- High-resolution favicons
- Code splitting
- Linting
- Serverless authentication
- Markdown editor in React
- Disqus Comments
- Google Analytics
- Deployment pipeline
- Responsive navbar

Of these, the following are done:

- Mobile friendliness
- Deployment pipeline

The following are put on hold indefinitely:

- Anything regarding routes:
  - Routes for individual posts
  - Pagination
  - Code splitting
- Anything that's a nice to have:
  - Markdown-it-katex, no console errors
  - js-sequence-diagrams
  - Metadata for each individual post
  - High-res favicons
  - Linting
  - Centering images
  - Disqus Comments
  - Responsive navbar
- Anything that would need a server
  - Google Analytics
  - Editor in React

Uh, yeah... Most of these will probably not be finished...

Kinda sad, but I think I should admit it to myself and to the world. There will
be other projects ahead where I can learn to tackle these problems.

So some more experience gained:

- Having a server is really nice. Serverless authentication is _technically_
  possible, if you use something like AWS Lambda. Which is basically a
  pay-per-execution server. Which given any meaningful scale, is going to
  require you to pay through the nose. Might as well have a backend. Not having
  a backend is the whole point of this blog.
- I don't know anything security as of right now, including XSS vulnerabilities,
  which are created if you use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React, which may
  have helped resolve some of the mathML console errors that I was seeing. I'm
  not going to expose myself to those practices if I don't need to, and
  certainly not because I have console errors.
- Code splitting through `react-router` is done through the routes. However, if
  you have one main route, I don't think you can split along route params. A
  server would help in this case too.
- I can't create new files in React alone. So no live editor unfortunately.
- I tried integrating high-res favicons, but it would just increase the bundle
  size and doesn't look all that much nicer.
- I'm probably going to be the only person who is posting here for the
  foreseeable future, and linting isn't all that necessary.

Where does that leave me now?

- Just continue to write posts, and if it gets too heavy (unbearable load times,
  unlikely because it should be load once and cached in the user's computer, and
  I can always add in a loading spinner), get a server.
