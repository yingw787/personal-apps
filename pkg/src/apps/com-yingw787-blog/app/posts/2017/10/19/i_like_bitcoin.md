This isn't an in-depth overview of Bitcoin or anything. This is just a funny story.

So back in 2015, I went to a party at Coinbase's then-new headquarters in the Financial District of San Francisco. The party was because of the new headquarters. It was a very nice office; they had gaming mouses and iMacs and ping-pong tables and the whole shebang. One of the developers there said that as they had recently raised a new round of funding, the VCs told them to spend money because spending money makes money and they ran out of relevant things to spend the money on. Hence the gaming mouses.

I went up to Brian Armstrong, the CEO of Coinbase. He's a really cool guy. So is Fred Ehrsam, the co-founder of Coinbase. I told Brian I wasn't a huge believer in Bitcoin. I didn't get the value. Or the point. Brian, being the awesomely cool guy that he is, said, "Bitcoin is awesome! Here, I'll give you five dollars in Bitcoin to start off, then you can start trading on our platform!" I was like, this is free money, I should take it. So I took him up on the offer.

I emailed him afterwards and said hey you promised me free money. He sent a payment of $4.99 in Bitcoin over to my Coinbase wallet. I promptly forgot about it.

Three weeks or so later, I received an automated email from Coinbase saying that I needed to accept this payment otherwise it will go back to its original owner. I sign in, take the payment, then promptly forgot about it.

Several months later, I read some article about Bitcoin from the corner of my eye and decide to check if that \$5 is worth anything. Lo and behold, it was worth \$40! I was like cool! Then I logged off and promptly forgot about it.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. I read another article about Bitcoin and decide to check if that \$40 is worth anything. Lo and behold, it was worth \$80! I said I'll exit when it hits \$90. A few days later, it hits \$90 - then drops back down to \$81. I decided to exit because why not.

I'm a simple man. 15x returns sound good to me.

Here's the proof below:

I bought a Chipotle burrito. I love Chipotle burritos.
