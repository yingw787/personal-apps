> "The male anglerfish is tiny by comparison (to the female anglerfish), like a tiny little baby. He attaches himself to the female by biting her, and then digesting part of his face so he fuses with her flesh. He then atrophies, losing his digestive organs, brain, heart, and eyes, and winds up nothing more than a pair of gonads, which release sperm when needed."

This past week was pretty funny, with entertaining stories as always from our satellite office web services division, which right now is more useless than a used-up male anglerfish. One story I'd like to share is how that giant English dictionary (created by the guy in ["That Happened, Part 2"](/posts/2017/10/15/that_happened_part_2)) is slowing down developer productivity. I discovered this this week when my colleague started laughing maniacally, and when I came over, showed me *all* the search results from the *two* `.txt` files that guy committed. It's literally a dragnet for search results, since *everything* is in it, and *nothing* in it is used on a day-to-day basis. After I laugh a bit (or a lot), I tell him that you can filter out `.txt` files and that problem should go away. He replies, "Yes, but *I shouldn't need to*", prompting even more laughing from me. One day my sides will split.

I've also found that:

**1)** The satellite office shenanigans are getting less funny, as I develop laughter resistance (they have to keep doing ever stupider things for me to laugh the same amount, and I don't think anything can cap what happened during ["That Happened"](/posts/2017/10/04/that_happened)).

**2)** They know we do not like them. Even the other divisions in our office are beginning to notice and are asking why they are still employed here. My colleagues on web services at our main office post mic drop gifs after roasting them on Slack, and constantly ghost their LinkedIn profiles (a very bad sign if you work together, as I have learned). They on the other hand are getting more rebellious with each pull request and are obviously ignoring our (still intentionally helpful) advice.

**3)** Our management is starting to notice the problem is rather intractable and assign them fewer and fewer bugs to fix and features to do. The useless-as-fuck team lead over there got zero bugs, last I checked. Of course, it's kind of this case already, but now instead of them not doing their bugs and features and having them fail over to other teams, it's now official. Our *director of engineering* sends emails to them saying he wants to review their code and documentation personally, and commented once on a pull request this past week saying that functionality should have unit tests.

Who knows? Maybe one day I'll stop writing about them, and it's either because they can't make me laugh anymore or because management decided to fire them. Perhaps by locking down their computers, having building security physically drag them out, and mailing their stuff back to them (heaven knows they've earned that). We should see the amount I write about them go down, if only because I should focus on the positive things in my life instead of the negative. I'll make a thoughtful, concerted effort to make that a reality.

I'm doing a hackathon with some friends next weekend at Capital One, and was going over the repositories I had both on GitLab and on GitHub.

(By the way, ***GitLab is fucking amazeballs***, definitely create an account there if you haven't already. GitHub hasn't even changed its *UI* from three years ago and posted a >$600M loss last year or something, while GitLab is unrecognizable after a few months because of all the cool new features they've added. Apparently, having a lot of open-source contributors develop your codebase for free so you can package it up and sell it to enterprise users for them to host on-site is an awesome business model. I need to copy that.)

I had a couple old repositories (with still live and running applications!) from when I first started learning JavaScript, and I wanted to share them with you like an old person shares an important milestone in their life. *cough*. Without further ado:

- [TreeTime](https://yingw787.github.io/timer): A productivity timer, written in jQuery, that uses the web browser [Notifications API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/notification). I used a script to procedurally generate images of two trees, one alive and one dead (because I can't draw and don't want to use random trees from Google Images that break my groove), and pasted them into my app, which allows you to set the time and shows you a picture of a live tree. If you switch tabs and stay on a different tab for too long, a notification will appear saying you killed your tree and the timer is aborted, better luck next time. Then the tree turns dead. The hope was that you would care about the tree enough to not switch tabs, a problem that I encountered when I had productivity problems (switching tabs to YouTube, or Facebook, or whatnot, while trying to work). Turns out, I didn't give a flying fuck about whether the tree was dead or alive, so the timer was useless in preventing me from distracting myself. Nowadays, I block domains entirely in my `/etc/hosts` file, which does the trick.

- [Random Quote Machine](https://yingw787.github.io/randomQuoteMachine): This application takes in a JSON file of quotes with authors, and displays them in a page. If you click on "New Quote", it selects another quote from the JSON file. It also changes the color, and allows you to tweet that quote if you wanted to. It's pretty lame because I think I followed a tutorial on how to do it, but this is how I learned to read files, a major step forward for me.

- [Portfolio](https://yingw787.github.io/portfolio): A portfolio of what I did with my life that's relevant to companies. Leaving this up because why not.

- [Traveltile](https://yingw787.github.io/traveltile_docs/): This one was a doozy of an application, an order of magnitude larger than the other ones. It was my first React application, and the first large application I developed by myself. I made this application for two reasons: I noted that making travel plans take a lot of time, and I wanted to automate that planning process, and that most people take the same trips or slight variations of the same trips, but only take it once, so sharing itineraries would make sense. Only the documentation is up now (because FileStack, the file sharing service I used, was kind of expensive and I was a poor college grad with $150 in the bank), but the application worked and people said it was quite polished. I stopped working on it because I thought that planning graduation trips would be a low-margin affair and I *needed to get a job*. I think the first part might be a rationalization on my part; there actually aren't any good applications out there to plan travel itineraries and share them with others. I might give it another shot later on.

And as a bonus :tada::

- [ShortRoad](https://shortroad.yingw787.com): Only a landing page to do some idea validation. I didn't go through with it because nobody responded to my requests for information (one guy said it was a shit idea and that actually dented my will to continue working on it quite a bit, so I won't do that again -- I'll just hang out on [Indie Hackers](https://indiehackers.com)), and because the company was literally losing developers every week and I thought I needed another job. It's a custom Hugo theme, custom in the sense that I ported an existing HTML5 landing page site over to Hugo myself, and customized that.

I really should continue to build side projects. My colleagues have told me multiple times that I should just build out Traveltile and just make money. I'm getting back at 7PM daily due to work, and ideally I'd like to maintain my commitments to blogging, reading, exercising, and sleeping, so time is generally quite limited. Thinking for nine hours straight is also pretty tough and thinking more is tougher. Maybe my standards are slipping. Maybe I'm getting old. Maybe my spirit is broken. I don't know. I do know that the gulf between where I am and where I want to be is widening and widening fast, and I need to do something about it.
