Yesterday was my one-year anniversary with the company I work at. [English Dictionary Man](/posts/2017/10/15/that_happened_part_2) (or is it [Stateful API Endpoint Man](/posts/2017/10/04/that_happened)) congratulated me at 9:23AM the morning:

[lol](/img/posts/2017/12/04/lol_2.png)

I included an example in my blog of [how to respond to a pull request](/posts/2017/11/18/pull_requests). I would say this is an example of how _not_ to respond to a pull request. Same dealio, different person.

According to management, it's just as bad to not recommend an outdated PEP8 standard (hard-wrapping 80 characters per line) as to send the above as a direct message. So I will be in a meeting tomorrow.

If English Dictionary Man is reading this: in six months, you'll be able to write code without protest however you like.
