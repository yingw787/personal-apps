I was surprised that the Barnes and Noble bookstore hasn't closed down yet. Apparently they got an extension on their lease from this year to January of next year. _Then_ they will be shutting down. I bought three more books a few weeks ago, and one of them was this little helper.

You know those books where you should know everything in it but you don't? That's kind of how I felt with "Code Complete", and that's also kind of how I feel with this book. There's a number of soporific platitudes in here, but honestly most of the advice in there is pretty helpful. I just have to take it.

It was about $5-10 in Barnes and Noble; I think for that price this is probably worth it. I might tabulate some of the best quotes on my website somewhere.

So the Christmas holidays are coming up :christmas_tree:, and I'll be doing a lot of reading. I don't think I've done a big book since "Code Complete", and it's partially because I need to work out a strategy for doing a book that is technically rich. I think I will just translate the knowledge in a web application of some sort.
