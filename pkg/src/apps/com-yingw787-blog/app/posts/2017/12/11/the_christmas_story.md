Giving to charity is one of my favorite things to do with money. It is certainly more fun than paying rent, paying taxes, and paying parking fees. It is even more fun to me than buying groceries and food at restaurants.

So when my friend Jordan asked me to share a blog post on giving, I couldn't say no:

If you haven't donated to charity yet. You should. It's not bad.
