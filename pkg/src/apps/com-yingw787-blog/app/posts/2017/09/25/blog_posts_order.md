So I made next Saturday's book review available on the live site just now. It's because I read through this book in one day, and I couldn't afford to wait until Saturday to write it (I just don't have the time). If I'm going to be able to write every day, though, how would I be able to balance that with work and cooking and exercise and social life and all that other stuff?

I think what I'm going to try and do is to come up with the topics and peer-edited articles ahead of time, and write the week's worth of blog posts on the weekend. And then after the day is done, do not edit those articles again. It's janky, but it's better than trying to post regularly every day. Yea? Maybe? No? Probably maybe.
