Anybody can start a business, but only a few can scale one. With that truth in
mind, "Scaling Up" provides not only valuable information about how to scale a
business, but also creates a framework and common vernacular to support it.

The book breaks up scaling a business into four major sections, *People*,
*Strategy*, *Execution*, and *Cash*. With an innumerable number of keywords and
charts to guide you along your journey, the author goes ahead and describes how
designing a process for a business creates reliable and repeatable (not to
mention desirable) results.

At the end of the book, the author relays a question about which business
leaders have made it to greatness and what commonalities they have. His response
was that great leaders have both an insatiable desire to learn and an
unquenchable bias for action. It ties back to the beginning of his book, where
he discusses how the most important habit of great people is their ability to
read or otherwise process vast amounts of information. I have found that to be
true as well. The smartest people I have met in my life have not been persuaded
by gloss and glory but instead incorporate the knowledge of other people's
experiences into their own.
