Satya Nadella, Microsoft's third CEO, had an interesting problem when taking on
the job: _"Now what?"_ He had this problem because Microsoft's mission as
defined by Bill Gates and Paul Allen was to place a computer in every household,
which was a pipe dream back when Microsoft was founded in 1975, and Microsoft
and others pretty much fulfilled that mission by the time Satya became CEO in
2014. His book, "Hit Refresh", gives readers insight into his desire to evolve
Microsoft into a humbler, more empathic company.

Satya introduces this desire early on in his book, talking about his first
interactions with empathy at Microsoft while interviewing with Richard Tait, and
discussing in depth his son Zain, who suffered from utero asphyxiation and
resultant cerebral palsy and needs constant care. By doing so, Satya conveys
that empathy isn't just a professional trait, but a highly personal one as well.

Microsoft isn't a historically empathic company, as Satya diplomatically points
out. Arrogance cost the company greatly in the 2000s, as the company suffered
from antitrust suits and missed the boat on mobile in spectacular fashion. Satya
moved to change that attitude by breaking down organizational barriers within
Microsoft and bringing customers closer to senior leadership. By understanding
customers and each other, Microsoft continues to build trust and confidence in
its products, as customers increasingly believe that their recommendations and
desires are heard and acted on, and employees believe that they work for each
other, even across different organizations.

This book is a good starter on Microsoft's new culture and the mindset of its
CEO.
