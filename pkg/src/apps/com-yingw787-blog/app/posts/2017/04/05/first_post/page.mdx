This is my first blog post on my new handcrafted blog.

I thought about going with a static website generator such as Hugo or Jekyll,
but after using them in the past I never felt like I had true ownership of what
I could or could not do. Hand-crafting a single-page application was better
because I knew each and every part of my stack, and I could swap out
dependencies more easily.

Current capabilities (4-5-2017):

- Support for:
  - Markdown!! (via markdown-it)
  - Syntax highlighting for code blocks (via markdown-it-prism)
  - Images (via file-loader and webpack)
  - File upload and fetching (via axios)
  - Basic routing (via react-router)

Remaining TODOs:

- Add in working support (no console errors) for:
  - UML diagrams or equivalent via markdown-it-mermaid or js-sequence-diagrams
  - TeX support w/ KaTeX via markdown-it-katex
  - Disqus comment forums or equivalent
  - Google Analytics integrations and SEO optimization
- Generate easily usable deployment pipeline with npm or bash scripts
- YAML or TOML base configs to go with each markdown blog post, because having
  metadata to organize by is nice at any meaningful scale
- Webpack code splitting with `react-router`
- Fully responsive and mobile-friendly navbar with hamburger icon
- In-browser real-time markdown editor for editing and generating new blog posts
- Serverless authentication (not sure if it's an oxymoron)
- Linting. So much linting.

I'll write a brief architectural overview of this application after getting it
deployed. Excited to see where this goes.
