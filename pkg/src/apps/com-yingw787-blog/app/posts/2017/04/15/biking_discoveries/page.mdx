Apparently I can't attach my grocery panniers regularly on my bike, because then
I can't adjust my seat. This is because there's a set of bungee cords attaching
the bottom of the pannier to the bottom of the bike frame, near the spoke hub.
They also don't fit when the seat is high, so it has to be kept to the lowest
height for the panniers to attach properly. Oh well.
