The [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic) is pretty
much over for me, but the Morning Poppins group is still going strong (I think).
So here's some of my brief thoughts.

It's a puppy-making machine!

This ended up being a lot more wholesome than I had originally anticipated.

Damn. The last time I went to morning pages was two months ago.

Tomorrow's Juneteenth, and I think this is the first time I'll have work off. I
think Congress recently passed a bill declaring this day to be a holiday, so
this will be a holiday I can celebrate wherever I go pretty soon.

That raises the question of what to do with all of my holiday time. I think at
home I still have a good amount of organizing and other stuff to do, but I'd
like to make some trips and go visit people. The question is who; I haven't
really kept in touch with folks from...well the entirety of my previous life so
there's not a whole lot of people to visit. I did purchase plane tickets to go
visit Jon in Texas for a week in middle of October, so that's pretty cool.

I would still like to visit Maine. And Vermont. And maybe a few of the national
parks along the East Coast.
