The [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic) is pretty
much over for me, but the Morning Poppins group is still going strong (I think).
So here's some of my brief thoughts.

Oh man. A month's worth of cute pictures and cute videos. Here's 4!!

There's been some changes since the last time I wrote here. I did manage to
attend a software conference, kind of. I'm going to personal training now,
because I'm fat and I'm finally doing something about it. I cleaned my apartment
top to bottom for the first time in a long time. And I got two bookshelves in
order to put all my books and stuff on!

Life's not bad. Work is still pretty great, and now I have some folks in order
to help me out with certain things. I did schedule a trip to Dallas in middle of
October to go see a close friend, so that's pretty cool. And I think I'm going
to try and do more things this year. Travel and live a little on the side.

I think today, I'm feeling kind of stress. I went on a date on Sunday and
honestly the person just stressed me out completely. It's a bit hard to trace my
nutrition and ensuring it's in a healthy range. Nothing that I didn't know; my
personal trainer mentioned that nutrition was the hardest part. I still have a
pretty not-great relationship with food that I need to correct. And I still feel
a little trapped because I don't have a car. All tractable problems to an
extent. So yeah, that's what's up right now.

I'm seeing whether I can write a little bit more, and maybe get back into
reading. I'm still watching too much YouTube.
