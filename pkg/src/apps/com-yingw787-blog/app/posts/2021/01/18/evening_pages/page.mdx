Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Catto is tired.

Or maybe catto is just full from eating dinner. I'm not sure.

I think 25,000 troops is the number going into the inauguration. And honestly
it's probably enough. Either it's enough or it's not enough, and we'll find out
in a few days. To be honest, if 25,000 troops aren't enough it's probably
because of some new-fangled technology, like those small assassin drone swarm
munitions or some area effect weapon like an EMP or a WMD like a suitcase nuke.
Eh, whatever.

Still expecting a 9/11-style attack later this year. Should remember to join
Arlington CERT.

In positive news, I wiped down my floor in my bedroom for the first time in like
two months. I think I've probably been shedding more skin cells or something,
but it took like two Swiffer wipes and 5 Clorox wipes in order to wipe down all
the surfaces in my bedroom. To be fair, I was wiping down areas I usually don't
wipe, like underneath my radiator, hence the Clorox wipes. I should use them
more sparingly because apparently Clorox wipes don't exist anymore. I still need
to wipe down my living room, kitchen, and bathroom this evening, but I lie down
in my bed and breathe the air and it just feels so much cleaner. And no more
dust bunnies!

Otherwise, been lying on my bed and relaxing a good deal. I think this weekend
was good. Not sure if this is work/life balance, but I do feel more refreshed
for the week ahead.
