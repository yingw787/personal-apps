Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

Such a happy catto!

Crazy to think that this is the first morning pages of the year. I would reallly
like to get a "I survived 2020" T-shirt, I think they're on sale right now. But
I don't think I care enough in order to spend $20, because I have a bunch of
other T-shirts anyways.

I spent the last three days or something crazy like that manually filling in
data from my financial ledger into a spreadsheet. I think there might be errors
at different points of this dataset, because I've already discovered I failed to
punch in a record about interest, confused the word `payments` with `paycheck`,
and described non-existent dates, such as `2/31/2018`, amid other fun errors.
Also fun when in earlier records I failed to use an `ipython` shell and either
used the calculator app on my iPhone or worse yet used my head and so the
checksums I thought would help actually hurt. Luckily, my recordkeeping has
gotten better over the years, and PostgreSQL's CSV processing tool is pretty
strict about what it accepts, and PostgreSQL has data wrangling tools I can
apply in order to clean data, so I'm not too worried.

This is the whole milk and cookies thing I was talking about `2020/12/31` coming
into view now, which is pretty neat.
