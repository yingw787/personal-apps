Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), I've been
locking myself down until I think it's safe to go out again. To alleviate fear
and stress, my writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages"
get-together on Zoom in order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some
of my brief thoughts.

I remember reading once that happiness is butterflies. Apparently a 3 year old
or something said that. Wiser than me.

Heehee. Doggee.

Also not sure whether Reddit is now only providing 240p video for export or
something, but video quality seems to have declined. Man if they keep this up I
might have to go somewhere else to find my cute animal pictures and videos.

I don't think anything was as grueling as doing all that manual data entry over
this past long weekend. It was long in hours spent and long in hours perceived.
Somehow I managed to get it done, but then fell into a bit of a stupor on
Sunday. So I still have 3 reports I need to do for my year in review, and then I
can start looking at apps I want to build or keep building.

I've been purchasing a goodly number of books recently. I'm not sure how the
stack grew so big so quickly, or why my credit card balance has blown out of the
water, but it has and it's kinda nuts. I'll need to read more this year in order
to publish the review and get them into boxes. I got a number of good titles
though! A lot of philosophy and religion books, and some technical books too.
Gonna try and change it up a bit.

Not sure if I've mentioned this anywhere but I'm reading the Bible from cover to
cover and hope to finish in around 2 years or so. Gonna go slow and see how far
I make it this time. Nice thing is, this time around I'm recording my notes in a
Google doc so that way I know I don't miss anything. We'll see what happens,
worst case scenario I drop the habit and then pick it back up a few months or
years later.
