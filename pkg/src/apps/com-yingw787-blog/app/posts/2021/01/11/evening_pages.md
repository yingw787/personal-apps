Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

The most adorable video I've seen all year.

I think this weekend was a good amount of decompressing and processing from the
week before. It was a lot. Gonna be fine enough just for the attacks on the 17th
and the 20th. Hooboy. It's the Troubles. To be fair, I don't think I should be
freaking out as much as I am. If I didn't watch the news, I probably wouldn't
even realize anything was going on. Well, besides the emergency curfew alerts
and stuff.

I'm not sure if I'm the only one doing this but I think I eat more expired food
than other people. It's not healthy. I have like this whole carton of eggs that
was expired in November of last year (and that I got like...September at some
point...) that I still keep in my fridge. I ate three of them today and I feel
pretty nauseous. I'm thinking about using them in my banana bread muffin mix I
got from Trader Joe's, but honestly the thought of eating those eggs just makes
me feel sick. I think I'm going to throw them out. On the plus side, I think
Costco membership is $60 / year instead of $60 / month, so I'm not sure why I
haven't purchased a Costco membership already. And a 24 ct. carton of eggs are
$7. Like quite literally, I have no idea what I'm doing with my life vis-a-vis
food. Trader Joe's seems like extortion now. I mean, hell, Costco even
delivers...

Anyways.

This month's been a bit of a mental decline for me. Not huge, not anything close
to before because I have a great support network and I feel like my time is used
well at work, but the great climb up from the holes of before during 2020 I
think is starting to plateau out and settle, and keeping my mental health high
is something that will take continuous work going forwards. I can probably start
by having a better work/life balance, maybe reading a bit more instead of
watching TV, and doing some more exercise. Don't think I have too much to say on
these fronts. I think I gotta go throw out those eggs. And sign up for Costco.
