Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Hey hey a Disney princess!

I think these pictures give me (an old-timer) some real happiness. Maybe I will
get to pet a deer in the wild sometime and not get West Nile or something.

You know, I didn't actually feel it early on, but now I am feeling the workload
at work increase some. It's probably because we're exponentially growing, and
the engineering team has shrunk a little bit for various reasons (none of them
because the company's a bad place to work). So yeah, the whole familiar "getting
pulled in multiple different directions" feeling is back, and I'm putting in
additional hours at the office to make sure I'm not blocking others from being
able to do their jobs. Great thing about this place though, is that I'm able to
finish these months-long efforts and close them off at a stable state before
switching away. That's never really happened before.

As a partial aside, I need to learn how Kubernetes works. Like quickly, lol.

I can't believe that the groceries I got from Costco are starting to run out. I
feel like $100 just doesn't get you very far these days. It's kinda crazy.
DoorDash for sushi costs $40, whereas I remember just before the pandemic,
picking it up in person costs like $15. Hmm, now that I think about it, maybe I
could make an in-person sushi run, especially if I'm getting colder sushi like
raw fish rather than something cooked.

Oh yes. For some reason it got pretty cold. Like I went outside yesterday in
order to toss recycling, and its like the air bit me. So I didn't go outside
yesterday, or day before. I'll see if I can get some exercise today.
