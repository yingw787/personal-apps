I borrowed this book from the library at the writer's salon, and finished this
400-page book in around a day and a half during this long MLK weekend. I've read
"A Thousand Splendid Suns" before this, and while it's different (more covers
the lives of Afghan expats as opposed to the lives of folks in Afghanistan),
there's some commonalities that Hosseini pulls together, such as rich symbolism
(the large oak tree that's mentioned in some way or another across three
generations), and a lot of conversations between characters, either spoken or in
print. I really like how their identities are shaped away from the world around
them; current events are mentioned only obliquely. There's a strong focus on
family, and certain constants and anchors throughout the book (e.g. a retreat
towards art by several characters independently).

I think this book resonates with me because I'm probably subconsciously looking
for anchors too. I think this entire time I've thought of Afghanistan as less
stable than the U.S., and now that that seems to be changing, I'm starting to
wonder what really stays the same over time and what do you really get to hang
on to. Hopefully the answer is something like not much, but more than you think.
Or something like that, I dunno.
