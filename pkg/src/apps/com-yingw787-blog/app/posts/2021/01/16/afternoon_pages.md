Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

FEED THE CATTO

21,000 troops is now 25,000, and apparently 14 states have activated the
National Guard in order to protect their state capitols ahead of the anticipated
violence. News always sucks, so I walked downtown in order to see what
Washingtonians were thinking. Well, every store that was not permanently
bankrupt wasn't boarded up, and people were outside eating, so that looked like
good news to me. I think the government is mostly interested in protecting the
National Mall (or "The Green Zone" as some friends call it), not sure if any
militias would get pushed into Georgetown or apprehended on-site.

Also a discreet but clearly visible Army and Secret Service / FBI presence in
Rosslyn too, they were in the hotel I passed by walking in and out when I went
to the bathroom. Probably getting a list of reservations from last week or the
next week.

In better news, apparently the incoming administration will look to give out 100
million doses of vaccine in the first 100 days, instead of taking half the order
and selling it overseas for personal profit then telling states to fuck off.
That'll be a good change I think.

I'm starting to read a bit more. I think I was surprised by how much I've read
last year and I fell out of the habit. So hopping back in with some easy reads,
and hopefully that'll translate to reading more complex books down the line.
