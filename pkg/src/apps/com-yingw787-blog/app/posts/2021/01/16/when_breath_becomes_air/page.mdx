I think this is the first book I've read in quite a while, and the first book
I've read this year. It's a book I borrowed from the library at the writer's
salon, and a fairly easy read because I'm not really in the habit right now. The
book is by and around a Stanford neurosurgeon diagnosed with lung cancer, his
life, and things that changed before and during his dying period. I think it's a
unique perspective to see somebody who's really smart and in medicine talk about
death and dying as it's happening to them. There's a number of unique stories,
such as treatment plans with his coworkers, operating on other patients while
sick, and others you don't get to hear about very often. It's kind of like ["The
Last Lecture"](/posts/2018/11/26/the_last_lecture).
