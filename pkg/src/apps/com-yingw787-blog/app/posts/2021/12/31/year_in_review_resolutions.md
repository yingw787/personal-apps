The days are long, but the years are short! Unlike last year, I think this year
kind of flew by. I definitely forgot about my [New Year's
Resolutions](/posts/2021/01/01/new_years_resolutions) again, and I think I'll
just keep forgetting them and it'll just have to be okay.

What did I promise the world I was gonna do for myself again?

So looking at what I promised,

- **<span style="color:green">Do things that make me happy (MEETS / EXCEEDS
  EXPECTATIONS)</span>**

  I think this year overall has been a very happy year for me. Work has turned
  out to be terrific overall, and I'm much more optimistic about my future now
  that this year's underneath my belt. I think that plays a huge role in my
  overall happiness because I spend at least 8 hours a day at work, usually
  those hours are the best hours I have while awake, and I view work as a path
  towards fulfillment and freedom. While my old manager left, I got a new
  manager, and made sure to hold out for eight months in order to find him,
  because he's the coolest person I've worked with so far and him being nice and
  flexible and smart means I can stay here and grow if I choose to.

  I've also encountered a good number of positive life events. This year, I
  bought my first property, a primary residence in the condo neighborhood I've
  lived in for a while. Given the COVID situation, and the growth of tech and
  the hiring of tech people everywhere, I think my long-term bet to live
  somewhere I'm happy is paying off, because the jobs are coming to me anyways.
  I've also purchased a brand new car, and that means I get much more comfort in
  going places (I've never been so happy when I have the car's heater on in the
  snow and I can just look at the snow outside and smile while also being warm,
  it's the most amazing thing ever). In all of these things, the titles listing
  me as a resident and owner and even paying taxes part, I feel like I belong
  somewhere. I think that's pretty big.

  I'm also starting to work out on a regular cadence from personal training, and
  being fit or fitter means not only do I feel better about myself, I also feel
  more confident when walking around in the street. I do notice my shirt being
  tighter in my chest and shoulder area, and women looking at me while I'm on
  the street

  I think overall, how I'd describe my year of happiness is "solidification".
  There's a lot of reasons to be happy for years to come because of the
  foundations I've laid down this year, and it's on me to practice gratitude and
  have those reminders.

  With my car, I was able to make a 1500 mile round trip journey, from D.C. to
  Princeton N.J, then through New York City and up to Boston, then over to
  Vermont, then to Ithaca, NY for a friend's wedding, then back home. It was a
  crazy journey; I drove through a hurricane or tropical storm near New Jersey
  (when NJ drivers go 30 mph on the Interstate, you know it's serious weather),
  drove through Manhattan by accident (Holland Tunnel does not take you from NJ
  to NJ, it takes you from NJ to NY), found out Conneticut drivers are crazy
  (the roads are really great so everybody's a BMW driver going 20-40 over, not
  using turn signals, crossing multiple lanes at the same time, and ambushing
  you from the right because there are no merge lanes), drove through the dagged
  streets of New England, took a lake ferry across Lake Champlain, and had a
  random box from the wedding engage my emergency trunk release mechanism on the
  highway. I also met up with a friend in NJ, walked around Liberty Park in
  Jersey City and saw the helicopters and planes over Manhattan, ate a lobster
  in Rockport MA (couldn't get the idea of revenge against cockroaches in my
  apartment out of my mind), went to Ausable Chasm in the Adirondacks in upstate
  NY, bought some fancy chocolates and hot cocoa and maple syrup for friend's
  wedding, and spent a good number of days and nights dancing, hiking, and
  telling stories around the fire with people I knew and people I've never met.

  That was just one trip!! All possible thanks to my car. Can't take a Lyft trip
  like this without spending thousands of dollars.

  I also did stuff like jump out of an airplane for the second time, go
  paddleboarding with friends near the Wharf and wave to a bunch of people,
  checked out some new Korean restaurants and Michelin Star restaurants with
  some friends, and went hiking to Old Rag and Harper's Ferry.

  I think I forgot a whole bunch of stuff this year until I actually racked my
  brain and a bunch of memories kind of fell out.

- **<span style="color:orange">Find another welcoming community with a productive
  interest (PARTIALLY MEETS EXPECTATIONS)</span>**

  I think for this one, I would say I've strengthed my friendships with the
  friends from college who live in this area by routinely attending meetups,
  I've kind of let my writer's group friends lag or hang by not attending all
  that regularly, and I picked up some acquaintances (if that?) by going to the
  gym on my own regularly apart from personal training. I don't think I've
  worked towards finding a new welcoming community with a productive interest. I
  was thinking more about sports leagues or ukulele groups or rejoining that
  board games meetup I used to go to for this bullet point, but I haven't done
  any of that. At this point, I'm pretty convinced that if I'm happy without
  having done this, then this point probably didn't matter as much as I thought
  it did.

Overall, I'd say it's a pretty successful year of personal growth, on the
broader front.

I wonder how I did on the other bullet points...the ones where I'm like I should
work on personal software and stuff...

- **<span style="color:orange">Replace more software I use for life management
  with software I write myself (PARTIALLY MEETS EXPECTATIONS)</span>**

  I'm starting to package stuff with `docker-compose`, and host it locally and
  deploy it into GitHub, but I'm not at the point of using Kubernetes, and
  deploying it onto websites. It's partly cost (I think a k8s control plane
  costs $100 per month in order to host), and it's also complexity and the
  capacity in order to learn. I think I need to learn Kubernetes for work at
  some point, so this might be an area I can crack. It's also partly the labor
  burden of having to keep systems up-to-date. I think there's automated ways in
  order to pull from upstream package archives, so ways in order to reduce that
  load too.

  I'm also not using my own software on a day-to-day basis, besides my hourly
  journal. I think being able to close the loop on that will be really helpful
  in making sure I continue personal development.

- **<span style="color:red">Ship personal software to production, with payments
  (DOES NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS)</span>**

  Yeah nope. I need to work on this next year, but probably phrase it slightly
  differently.
