My gratitude journal practice has definitely fallen off a cliff this year. This
is pretty much what I've been able to get down this year that's of material
meaning:

![wordcloud](/img/posts/2021/12/31/wordcloud.png)

It seems like:

- **I derive a lot of utility from doing things**: I notice verbs like "talked",
  "watched", and "ate" being big things I'm grateful for. I think this generally
  lines up with how I think I derive gratitude. I like doing things, doing
  things makes me happy. I infinitely prefer experiences and memories over gifts
  and possessions.

- **I like trying new things**: I can't miss the "first time" sign smack dab in
  the middle of the screen. I've tried a ton of new stuff over the course of
  this year, and I think I'm most excited when things are new and I have all the
  space in the world to explore.

- **Food is huge for happiness**: I love good food. I've been watching my budget
  kind of balloon out of control because of buying and trying new food, and I'm
  honestly kind of over minimizing costs on food because it just brings so much
  joy to my everyday life. Food is also the flip side of working out, so now
  that I'm powerlifting I need to focus on food intake anyways.

I started the year in review for my gratitude journal because I thought it would
be helpful for me to close the loop on understanding where I am emotionally over
the course of the year. I think given my ability to maintain therapy sessions
over this year, as well as relieving stress by going to the gym and
powerlifting, I might deprecate this gratitude journal for now, and rely on
tracking gratitude practice alongside my hourly journal instead.
