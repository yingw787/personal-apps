I can't believe it's been like 6 months since I last read a book and published a
book review here. Work has been incredibly busy. But I have a week and a half
off for Christmas and New Year's, and so I decided to take some time and start
reading again. A bit of light reading, some non-technical nonfiction by this guy
named Simon Sinek.

I think this book came by recommendation by a life coach hired by my company; I
purchased these books a few months ago and haven't opened them until now. This
book is a refreshing viewpoint on leadership and what it's meant to be. I think
it does a really good job in terms of portraying what makes teams cohesive in
fundamentally solid terms.

It's also relevant since the data engineering team at my company has scaled from
just me to myself + mid-level FTE + junior-level FTE + manager + product manager
+ 5 software contractors, and I'm the only senior IC among them. We also have
  plans to create an engineering division for data by end of next year. Scaling
  a team and a division isn't something I've done before, and so I think it's
  pertintent to read books on effective leadership.

Some of the lessons I really liked are:

- **Seeing people for the humans they are:** Understanding that people are
  primal beings, driven by chemicals like endorphins (selfish, to mask physical
  pain), dopamine (selfish, the good feeling), serotonin (selfless, the
  leadership hormone), and oxycotin (selfless, the friendship / deep trust
  hormone), is something Sinek portrays quite well. There's also cortisol, the
  stress hormone; Sinek mentions how great teams look to release selfless
  feel-good chemicals much more so than selfish feel-good chemicals, and keep
  cortisol to a minimum.

  I very much agree that people are primal beings. Ignoring our emotions is one
  mistake I made that cost me dearly when I was younger. When you think about
  it, it's pretty straightforward; you can have all the smarts in the world, but
  if you don't want to get out of bed in the morning, none of that really
  matters.

- **Observe and enlarge the circles of safety:** "Circles of Safety" is a
  concept Sinek uses to describe who is "in" and who is "out". As a social
  species, we tend to have a particular "tribe" we want to belong to. The wider
  that is, the more belonging we feel; the smaller it is, the less belonging and
  more afraid we feel.

  I find this highly insightful. I think trust is the foundational keystone to
  building a great team; I've noticed that when I've stopped trusting somebody,
  my mind tends to think not about the state space of what makes sense, but
  rather what is possible to be done by a certain individual. You can scope that
  state space to the things immediately in front of you, but it's little
  comfort. Conversely, when I actively listen and say "I hear you, I acknowledge
  your concern is important, let's see what we can do to address it" and my
  trust is rewarded, I get a pretty big rush of oxycotin. I live for the natural
  high.

  I think one thing I've noticed is the official and unofficial circles of
  safety. For example, a manager might have a mandate to take care of their
  team, and on paper have that circle of safety, but if that manager doesn't do
  their job, then that circle of safety doesn't exist in real life. It does
  start from the top, honestly.

- **We need challenge in our lives to make life worth living:** I think Sinek
  masks this with millenial-bashing and politicking somewhat, but the point is
  clear enough to me. Without challenge, without growth, we begin to rot from
  the inside. Going in a direction, any direction in the generally positive
  method, allows us to check and refine our emotional and psychological
  compasses, and exercises our mental muscles. That's why I like reading :) I
  like having a wall to push against, and I find seeking out new things to do to
  be very exciting.

  I think one leadership principle I communicate to members of my team is "I'll
  never ask you to do anything I'm not willing to do myself." A lot of the job
  they're doing I've already done, and what's boring for me is interesting for
  them, and that makes things easy to delegate and for them to trust my judgment
  in difficult situations. I do acknowledge I do a lot of things (change my own
  engine oil, go skydiving, etc.), but I think it makes it morally easier for me
  to ask others to do hard things too and to push others.

Overall, I think these things run in cycles. Bad times create strong people,
strong people create good times, good times create weak people, weak people
create bad times. I think right now we're in the "weak people create bad times"
phase, and so it's just up to us to rise to meet the challenge.

I also like thinking about "happiness as a metric". The problem with most
metrics is that you tend to measure and overfit on them, and then it ceases to
be a good metric; but happiness is useful in and of itself, and is incredibly
difficult to overfit (e.g. "one glass of wine will make you happy, one bottle of
wine will make you an unhappy alcoholic"). I want to be happy and I want people
on my team to be so too.
