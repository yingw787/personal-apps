I've been mentioning relationship issues (mostly the fact that I don't have one)
to the psychotherapist I've been seeing, and she recommended me this book to
read. I got it a few months ago and got the chance to read through it over the
past couple of days. I think it's fairly insightful; the most useful thing I've
found overall is the immense amount of structure Logan builds into her book
(lots of forms and checklists and what-not), with experience and reasoning to
back it up.

Here's some insightful points I've remembered about the book:

- **The dating market is full of lemons:** Logan mentions how in terms of a
  cross-section of people, 50% of the population is emotionally secure, while
  the other half is "anxiously attached" (sending a lot of messages if you don't
  respond) or "avoidantly attached" (the "I need space" people); however,
  emotionally secure people get snatched up pretty quickly, which means the
  dating market is full of emotionally insecure people. The positive spin on
  this news is if you work on yourself and become an emotionally secure person,
  you should have little to no problem with getting into serious relationships.

  I definitely felt this point. I think for most of my life I've been pretty
  emotionally insecure, and only very recently (like maybe since middle of this
  past year?) did I really come into my own and feel like I'm walking on solid
  ground emotionally vs. on a tightrope. I definitely didn't think I'd be able
  to help support somebody else before, but now I think I might be ready. In any
  case, I'm glad I focused on myself and had a lot of "me" time.

- **Slow burn strategy is underrated:** In a world of dating apps and analysis
  paralysis, getting the chance to know somebody beyond just a few photos can
  make you stand out. After all, you really only need to be right once. So
  putting yourself out there, in the form of co-ed sports, or book clubs, or
  other forms of activities, will help form those bonds and see people as a
  whole vs. seeing them as a gaggle of metrics.

  I feel this. One of my friends mentioned the need to put myself out there more
  often, and I honestly haven't done so due to the busyness of work. But if I
  don't want to die alone, I gotta bite the bullet soon. Thankfully, I've got
  some friends in my writer's group, who I honestly might want some help in
  getting me set up. Luckily, there's a section in "setting up with some
  friends or friends of friends" where you quite literally ask friends for help
  in getting set up, including paying them for their troubles (thought never
  actually crossed my mind). Maybe I'll try that this year.

- **Plan difficult conversations:** Make sure to prepare for them (e.g. dress up
  for conversations around marriage, spread out those conversations over a few
  months to digest information), know how to fight well, and have a breakup
  plan, all to enact your own agency. Honestly, it's probably the same tactics
  you would use at a healthy workplace; why wouldn't you use them with the one
  you love?

I think this book didn't talk about anything I didn't really know (I mostly was
like "yeah that makes sense" to everything), but having a coherent plan and
seeing everything laid out in front of you is helpful for visualizing a path
forwards, and that engenders a sense of hope that can't come with wishful
thinking. I'll probably look to refer to this book once I get serious about my
dating plan.
