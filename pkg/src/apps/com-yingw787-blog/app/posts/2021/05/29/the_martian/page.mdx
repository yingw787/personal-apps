This book is one of the few wooks where I've watched the movie adapatation (w/
Matt Damon), before reading the book. I found the book sitting on the shelf of
the writer's salon last Saturday, and decided to go ahead and read it.

Man, this is one of those books that you can't put down. Mark Watney, space
botanist, gets hit by some debris after evacuating Mars during a sandstorm, and
spends a year and a half growing and eating potatoes in his own poop (also poop
from others). After discovering Watney alive, the entire world bands together in
order to save him. Finally, Watney takes off from Mars and is saved by his
crewmates, who spend an extra year and a half to get him.

What I love most about this story is Mark Watney's personality, which shines
through during the journal-based approach the book takes through most of the
course. Sure, the hard science behind the narrating and Watney's calculations
provide an element of realism, but by being relatable Watney makes his struggle
our own, and that's what sucks me in.

I wonder if Weir would consider a sequel, or a trilogy, it'd be cool if somebody
else had similar survival stories, and see Watney as an old sage of some sort.
That'd be pretty cool.
