I found this show by searching on Netflix. I've wanted to watch anything by Mike
Schur for the first time again after watching "The Office" and "Parks and
Recreation". While I haven't seen "Brooklyn Nine-Nine", I did find "The Good
Place" on Netflix. After I watched through the whole thing, I think this is Mike
Schur's masterpiece.

The show chronicles Eleanor, a rather selfish person, who must traverse the
afterlife in order to get to "The Good Place". Along the way, she meets folks
from the afterline, and other dead souls, in order to plan her escape.

The biggest thing about Schur's creations is that they're pretty consistent
throughout their humor and execution, even though there's plenty of twists and
turns in order to keep you sucked in. They're also great at showing the best
sides of people; during Eleanor's journey, she does become a better person, and
so do all that help and follow her. Schur is a stickler for happy endings, and
"The Good Place" is no exception.

Highly recommend people to check it out, if you're interested in the ultimate in
Schur's handiwork.
