Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Ohhhhhh my God. I haven't done any moving, or cleaning, all weekend. I think
it's because I was sick yesterday with something and didn't get a whole lot of
sleep, and that my parents haven't come since the car battery in the minivan
died, and it just hasn't sunken in yet that I canceled my Internet and
electricity at my current place to start at my new place tomorrow (though I
still need to transfer over natural gasssssssssss).

Sigh. Hopefully today I'll be able to get most of the important stuff
transferred over. Then I can at least start working tomorrow and not have to
take another day off. Though I should probably touch base with my manager about
this sometime today.

Some pictures of me and a gift basket from my realtor:

There's a bag of Cheetos in my gift basket. If I buy another apartment, I
probably get another bag of Cheetos.
