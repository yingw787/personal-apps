Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

I think now I'm in the food-binge phase of the pandemic. Like I can't think of
anything else except food. Which is weird, because I have food at home, and I'm
still getting takeout, and I'm just thinking about that during the entire day.
I'm moving less, and have less of a reason to eat a lot of food, and yet I'm
still hungry. Interesting.

I think people are talking more and more about Asian-American discrimination. I
haven't experienced any myself yet, but I might soon. It'd be nice to write
about it on this blog and see whether my thoughts make any sense.

So many things to do. I think I'm less time-bound, and more energy-bound. That's
another thing, how is it that I can eat food and have less energy and then still
have less energy to do things...?
