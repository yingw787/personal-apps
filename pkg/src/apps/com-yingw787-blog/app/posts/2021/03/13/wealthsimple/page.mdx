So for some reason I haven't had a whole lot of luck with financial institutions
lately. After taking all my money from [Marcus by Goldman
Sachs](/posts/2021/02/24/marcus_update/) and running all the way back to Schwab,
I get this gem of an email from WealthSimple:

> We are reaching out today to provide you with an important update regarding
> your Wealthsimple investment accounts. We would like to inform you that after
> careful consideration, we have made the decision to no longer provide
> investment advisory services in the US and will be transferring all existing
> accounts to Betterment over the coming months.

[wtf](/img/posts/2021/03/13/wtf.gif)

I got introduced to WealthSimple through a stranger / professional network
contact I reached out to, a Canadian software contractor based out of Vancouver
if I remember correctly. WealthSimple, this Canadian fintech company,
auto-invests your money based on a "risk profile" of your choosing from a
savings account. As far as I know, that's mostly it. It does roundups for credit
card expenditures as well.

Okay, so I don't want to get kicked over to Betterment, I'd rather just
centralize my holdings into Schwab. I used the contact's referral link in order
to save on management fees for the first $10k I invested. I invested about $12k
using this platform, so a good chunk of change.

So far, I have lost $300. It happens, but you know. Cherry on top and all.

Then I get this email from WealthSimple support:

> Thank you for choosing Wealthsimple! It looks like the recent transfer to your
> account was returned with the note that the bank account chosen for the
> transfer has been closed. The bank has now been removed as a funding source
> from your Wealthsimple account. Our custodian charges a $30 fee for these
> failed transfers; however, I have processed a credit for the NSF fee now. This
> will be reflected in 5-7 business days. Feel free to Add a New Bank Account
> and then re-initiate your deposits.

Ah yes. Since I closed by Marcus account, and since I linked my WealthSimple
account to Marcus, closing my Marcus account caused the auto-debit to fail,
which made WealthSimple unhappy. Human centipede of shit.

I begin transferring funds back into Schwab. I discover that WealthSimple has
been purchasing gold and other crap because "it's not that risky". Apparently
WealthSimple is backed by Apex Clearing, based out in Texas, which has a 2.5/5
rating on Google Maps. I can't get my statements, it results in an HTTP 500
error. I call WealthSimple. Nobody answers. I have no idea how long the wait
queue is. I hang up after 15 minutes. I can't get my money out, because the app
is failing and I have no idea what my Apex account number is. I want to nuke
Toronto.

What is so hard about running a company that's essentially just one cron job??
And why withdraw from the U.S. market anyways? It's not big enough? Not
unregulated enough? Not profitable enough? I don't get it.

The app starts working again. I initiate a transfer from Apex to Schwab. It's
still ongoing. Not sure what the wait is all about, but I've heard it can take a
little while (a few weeks).

Schwab has [intelligent, automated
investing](https://www.schwab.com/invest-with-us/automated-investing) now too.
So I might just go with that instead of using another platform. Schwab was nice
to me when I was poor, and it is still nice to me when I have hundreds of
thousands of dollars of debt from my mortgage. I don't get why I looked
elsewhere. Always believe in papa Schwab. Don't go anywhere else.
