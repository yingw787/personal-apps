Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Dog snuggling puppy.

That's some PTSD in those eyes right there. Probably lack of sleep.

I biked over to the writer's salon with full equipment and met up with people
for the first time since the pandemic began! Hugely irresponsible, but I felt
starved for being around people and decided to take the risk. The e-bike was
critical to me getting up and running. Turns out, the stairs in some of these
old buildings are a bit too narrow to get it all the way upstairs in an easy
manner, so I had to leave it in the lobby.

I think today will be a good day. I need to try out some Indian food, or maybe
some BBQ from a place that isn't Rocklands. I might even want to go visit the
Capitol and see all the troops there and the giant black fence. I want a Capitol
tour (not the invading kind just the sightseeing kind). I wonder if the Library
of Congress is open or if that's also fenced off.
