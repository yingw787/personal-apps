Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

I think the moderators of `r/aww` have been linking to other subreddits; this
one was `r/purrito` for all kitten burritos.

So these last few days have been busy! I'm in the final stages of closing the
apartment and making sure that I don't fuck anything up by responding promptly
to the inquiries of the lender and delivering documents and all that good stuff.
I also haven't unpacked by CARBO e-bike. I think I probably will do that before
I move into the new place, it's just a lot of work. However! I did make progress
on `oneitemstore` by spending two hours fiddling with `nx` and deciding to toss
it all out and go with `create-react-app` instead, and I did finish my TV show
(House M.D.) which has been an outstanding commitment for a number of months
now. So now I can read books instead!

I think it's actually somewhat healthy to force myself to relax. I have a hard
time relaxing, and given how I have some stress limit I went beyond before,
forcing myself to operate within that performance envelope I think will keep
this positive steak going longer.
