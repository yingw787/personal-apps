Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

That's some PTSD in those eyes right there. Probably lack of sleep.

I biked over to the writer's salon with full equipment and met up with people
for the first time since the pandemic began! Hugely irresponsible, but I felt
starved for being around people and decided to take the risk. The e-bike was
critical to me getting up and running. Turns out, the stairs in some of these
old buildings are a bit too narrow to get it all the way upstairs in an easy
manner, so I had to leave it in the lobby.

I think today will be a good day. I need to try out some Indian food, or maybe
some BBQ from a place that isn't Rocklands. I might even want to go visit the
Capitol and see all the troops there and the giant black fence. I want a Capitol
tour (not the invading kind just the sightseeing kind). I wonder if the Library
of Congress is open or if that's also fenced off.
