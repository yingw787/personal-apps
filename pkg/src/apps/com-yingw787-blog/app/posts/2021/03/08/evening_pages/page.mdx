Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Hmm, what's on my mind today. Not a whole lot, honestly. I'm not sure what
exactly I did today. Time does seem like it's passing more quickly, especially
when you don't use your time very well.

Yesterday, I did do a lot of biking. I went into D.C. and back without breaking
a sweat. I can do this now, because I have my CARBO Model X e-bike. It's the
carbon fiber, folding, electric bicycle that I was pining about. Here it is,
fully unpacked, before its maiden voyage:

Isn't it glorious??

I should think of it more as a tool. But damn, if it isn't a sexy e-bike. I
mean, I guess that's partially why I got it. I wanted something nice as a
regular ride. Now, I'm a little afraid about leaving it outside if I need to run
into a BBQ shop real quick and get something. I should also keep in mind that
the battery will decay and I need to use it often in order to not have the
battery capacity decline.

Here's some of the stuff I learned about my e-bike, and about biking in general
that I had forgotten:

- **I should bring my bike charger with me wherever I go:** Range anxiety is
  still a thing, even though a trip to DC and back only took 50% of the battery.
  I'd like to know I can charge my bike in different places.

- **I need to wear gloves:** At the speeds this e-bike allows me to go, my hands
  become really, really cold. I need to make sure I bring my gloves with me
  where I ride, so that way I'm not concerned about losing control of my bike.

- **The bike is still pretty heavy:** At 30 pounds, I think it's one of the
  lighter e-bikes out there, but it's no cakewalk for my skinnyfat arms. I need
  to exercise more in order to carry the bike back and forth.
