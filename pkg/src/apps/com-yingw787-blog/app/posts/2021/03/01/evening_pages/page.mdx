Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Different species, same feels.

Don't they just look comfortable!

It's the 1-year anniversary of COVID-19!

Just kidding, I think the 1-year anniversary has already passed us by. It might
be a few weeks until the 1st anniversary of quarantine though. I'm never good
with anniversaries.

In good news, this year has had very little flu, according to [the Associated
Press](https://apnews.com/article/flu-has-disappeared-us-pandemic-2145d999319b53d8a32a829a324f398d).
And people are starting to get vaccinated! Like now I'm not sure if people
without masks are insanely irresponsible or just got their vaccine. I'd probably
not be all that optimistic as them because of all the COVID-19 variants walking
around, but I'm glad my terror is replaced by confusion.

In other news, my CARBO carbon-fiber electric folding e-bike, has arrived! It's
a very large box:

I need to unpack it but if all goes well I should be far more mobile over the
coming days, which is something I'm very much looking forward to :wine_glass:

I don't think I did a whole lot this weekend, so `oneitemstore` is still
outstanding. Maybe I should switch from weekly to bi-weekly updates.
