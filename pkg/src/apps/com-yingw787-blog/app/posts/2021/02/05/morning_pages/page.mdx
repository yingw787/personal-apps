Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

This kitten is waking up!

I guess it's time for me to wake up too.

So I gave the presentation yesterday, and it was very meh. Turns out, preparing
minimally results in me sucking at what I know. I also published the blog post
and two people unsubscribed. I'm just glad I got that out of my system. It feels
like the sword of Damocles has dropped and didn't chop my head off entirely, so
now I can worry about the future and make shiny new commitments instead of
taking care of older ones.

Oh yes, I think there still are older commitments I've made I need to care of.
But nothing that's strictly embarrassing.

I started working on `oneitemstore.yingw787.com`. I templated out a brand new
`nx` repository, and started working on a `docker-compose` and Docker setup for
running the app in development mode, containerizing the Firebase local
emulators, and building assets and shipping them to production (whatever that
may look like). Not sure why I'm having this craving. But hopefully it sticks
until I ship the whole thing.
