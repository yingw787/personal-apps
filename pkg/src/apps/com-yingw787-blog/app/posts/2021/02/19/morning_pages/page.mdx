Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

So I found a picture of a really shiny golden horse, and I had to add it:

Apparently you can find them in Turkmenistan. I don't know if I'll be visiting
Turkmenistan anytime soon, but if I was, seeing these horsies would be at the
top of my bucket list.

So the condo closed yesterday (sellers accepted my offer), and now I'm under
contract in order to deliver around $200,000 over 15 years. Ideally, I'd like to
pay it off quicker than that, like just start a company, sell it, and then pay
off my mortgage in 3 years kind of quick. I do not like debt. At the same time,
it would realllllly suck if I did that, then encountered some need to get a lot
of money upfront really quickly, and then had to refinance my paid-off condo for
a higher interest rate. So maybe the idea is to see a mortgage as a security
rather than just all debt. I mean, I guess the condo fees are high enough as it
is.

So I'll be moving into that new place in a month or so. Should be fairly
exciting.

In other news, I'm also looking at Burlington, Vermont as a possible summering
location. Apparently, it's right next to a lake, which feeds directly into the
St. Lawerence. And Quebec is right across the border. And the people there are
New Englanders!

I need to go read some math or physics books. I had a dream I failed 10th grade
physics last night and it was traumatizing. Also can't do some basic math
anymore. I think laughing it off is maybe the right response because I have
Python which does the simple stuff my mushy headmeat might mess up. But maybe I
am getting dumber and maybe it's not that funny. So much to learn, so little
time.
