Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Hey look, it's Indiana Ruff!

He's off to search for buried treasure!

So the Super Bowl was this past weekend, and it looks like Tom Brady won another
title. I was walking down to D.C. in order to check out what it was like there,
and bars were kinda packed (?), but every TV, packed or not, was tuned to the
Super Bowl. I hope people had fun.

There's this taco truck next to my apartment, called Taco el Torito, and it
serves up some pretty decent burritos. I don't know why I pay for DoorDash, but
it's so friggin' expensive (like I paid $300...for delivery alone...for the past
two weeks...and my goal is $62...), and there's this taco truck next to my place
that's plenty good already. I need to try the beef soup, and maybe the carne
asada, instead of taking dumb risks like buying a burger from a place not called
Five Guys (got a burger from BGR and it was like eating a meatball boiled in
butter).

Apparently Democrats are shooting themselves in the foot again, trying to lower
eligibility for the one-time stimulus checks from $75k to $50 for singles (gross
income 2019 tax return). Playing right into the Republican strategy of
divide-and-conquer, even though they control both houses of Congress and the
White House. So it looks like everything is back to normal. If you don't mind
the new Jew space laser people walking around.

AND! Ali from DC Writer's Salon got me this schwiffy mask for Valentine's Day!

To be honest, not quite sure how effective the mask is given how loose it is,
but I'm wearing it mostly for cosmetic decoration, since I already have a KN94
and two surgical masks over that (for a total of four masks).
