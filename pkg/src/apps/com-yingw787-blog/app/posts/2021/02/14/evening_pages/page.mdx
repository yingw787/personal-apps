Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

There was a picture of a bird kicking another bird off a ledge that I saw that
was pretty cool, but then it got taken down for some reason and I don't want to
find another picture. Hey who knows, maybe it'll get restored.

I made steak and broccoli for dinner today!

So basically this steak was wet-aged (meaning I left it in the package for a few
days because I forgot it was in the fridge), and then cooked by adding a little
cooking oil to a frying pan (when I had a cast iron), and then placed on a hot
dinner plate I fetched out of the just-finished drying cycle in the dishwasher.
So basically a lot of chance.

Turned out great though! This is what it looked like on the inside!

Medium-rare, creamy goodness.

Also I might be buying a condo, but we'll see what happens.
