Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Also such a patient pupper.

So this is a funny snippet from the acquittal of our beloved POTUS45. One U.S.
senator from his party voted to convict him and his state party is not happy.
This is a correction the New York Times had to make in [this
article](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/opinion/trump-mconnell-republicans.html):

Wanted to make sure that I for one think not convicting people who have commited
crimes because they're popular is not a good idea. But we'll see in four years.

I'm taking three days off of work. I think it'll be useful in order to have that
time to pack up my things + index them, clean the apartment + repair any damage,
file my taxes, and oh yeah have a little bit of fun because this will
technically have been the first couple days off I've had in more than a year
(before it was sabbatical and trying to find a job or a mental wellness day I
took after the insurrection).

I'm not quite sure what I'm going to do. Just that it should be pretty
balls-to-the-wall awesomeeeee.
