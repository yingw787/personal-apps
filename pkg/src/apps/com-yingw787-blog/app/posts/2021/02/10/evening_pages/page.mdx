Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Heheh, dog baby.

On a serious note, that looks comfortable and I want one. I was going to say
just the bed, but if the dog comes with he will get tummy rubs.

I got two 3-roll sushi combos from a local sushi takeout joint. Yup, 6 rolls, 3
salmon rolls with avocado and 3 tuna rolls with avocado, and 2 miso soups. I ate
it all. For lunch. I'm not sure if it was a good idea, I think it was an actual
bad idea, but I wanted to continue to prove to myself that DoorDash is not worth
it, and what better way to do that than to cram my face full of good and cram my
brain full of serotonin by eating food that would cost a fortune via app? You
know? I don't think I'll do it again, but that last burger purchase from
DoorDash...man...that's gonna stick as a pretty big contrast to what I can get
locally.

I don't think I've worked a whole lot on `oneitemstore.yingw787.com` a whole lot
since it's come out. I think I'll start publishing weekly updates until that's
done. I'm looking into things I want to get besides food delivery, and
uh...houses and cars are expensive, like hella expensive if you buy them
outright. I don't think I do very well in the stock market, and I think a
recession is probably coming anyways, so while I'll keep investing there to buy
the dip whenever that comes or to insure myself against hyperinflation, that's
both draining my savings and not providing immediate, realized gains. I need to
build capital, and I don't think there's ever a good time to do that.

Otherwise, things seem...steady, to a degree. I really like how quiet things
are. I need to prove to myself that I can get shit done though, and that I don't
relax without somebody riding me and therefore I don't need to be ridden.

I think I need to make my own luck, and my own fun. Why not build?
