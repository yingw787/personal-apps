So I bought a copy of the Constitution along with the Bill of Rights, and the
Declaration of Independence, and I'm telling you, reading it in 2021 is just so
depressing. I don't know what I expected, but I thought we would follow most of
it. I don't think we do that anymore, actually. It's crazy to think that this
document was written on animal skin by a bunch of slave-owning, wooden-teethed,
white wig-wearing folks who seceded from their nation, and yet they're leaps and
bounds wiser than we are. Then again, maybe they're the only ones who could.

I mean, just look at these clauses from the Constitution:

> The President shall, at stated times, receive for his services, a
> compensation, which shall neither be increased nor diminished during the
> period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within
> that period any emolument from the United States, or any of them.

oof.

> The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States,
> shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason,
> bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.

oof.

> Nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

oof.

> Excessive bail shall not be required, nor execessive fines imposed, nor cruel
> and unusual punishments inflicted.

oof.

> No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress...shall have
> engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid and
> comfort to the enemies thereof.

oof.
