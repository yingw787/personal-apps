Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

This video was so good I downloaded it onto my phone just to make sure I would
have a copy in case the Reddit mods got rid of it for some reason. He's so smol!

Today I woke up after maybe 3 and a half hours of sleep. Not sure if I'm going
to crash later today, but decided to get up and be productive instead of
wallowing in bed. First time in a long time that I woke up early, maybe if this
becomes a habit it'll even be healthy for me (not the getting so little sleep
part but the waking up early part).
