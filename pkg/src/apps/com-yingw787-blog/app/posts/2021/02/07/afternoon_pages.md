Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

I thought this was a kitten stealing a sock.

I was wrong. This is a puppy stealing a sock. A very cute and fluffy puppy.

It is very cold outside these past few days. I don't think I've gone outside all
that much. Apparently, there's ice, icy rain, and snow supposedly all this week.
We got an inch of snow this year so far, and while most of it has melted, I
think the weatherman said we might get another six inches, which might just be
another inch in actuality.

Oh yes. Super Bowl is today. It's one team vs. another. Apparently they've been
playing throughout COVID, which I guess they can do because they have sources to
give them tests and vaccines ahead of everybody else. Though, some players on
some teams still got sick and didn't play as well because someone or other
couldn't play a certain position. So that's fun. I got burger for lunch today
and it was pretty awful, didn't know you could make an awful burger. Don't buy a
burger from BGR, just get Five Guys next time for a burger craving.

I should do some reading and professional development work today.
