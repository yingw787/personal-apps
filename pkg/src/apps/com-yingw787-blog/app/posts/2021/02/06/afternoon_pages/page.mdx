Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Hehe. Wiggling cats.

Hehe. Hehehe.

So yesterday was not a fun day at all. I think for whatever reason I was so
exhausted I couldn't work. Work computer also started to just shutdown for
whatever reason (like I just couldn't connect to some websites because the
network card was so slow), and that meant I had to re-image my laptop which took
an entire day. So that just sucked all around. Also not fun conversations with
parents and friend.

I think I still need to exercise some of my coping mechanisms. Exercise is one,
yesterday couldn't really do a whole lot because of how tired I was. No excuse
for not meditating though, or not journaling.

I asked my manager if I could go on vacation during the last week of February,
and he said yes! I wonder what I would do during that time period. I really want
a massage, but I don't want to go and have to meet other people in order to do
so, because pandemic. I want to go hiking in the wilderness, but if I rent a car
and/or cabin I might be exposing myself to COVID, because pandemic. And now with
the decreasing efficacy of the vaccines due to the new variants of COVID...it's
just hard right now to be happy because a lot of the external factors for
happiness just aren't there. I think I'll have to self-quarantine for a few
months longer, until I get the vaccine. Otherwise, I'll have so much regret if I
get COVID now since it's so so close. Also with the looming repeal of ACA in the
coming years COVID will almost certainly be a pre-existing condition and I don't
want my healthcare premiums to skyrocket.

Hmm, lemme brainstorm stuff I could do. I guess I could go on a run and use my
CamelBak (though I need to clean it somehow). I could use the exercise bench I
got for myself (which should be thoroughly COVID-free after I wiped all the
parts down with an alcohol wipe and let it air dry). I could keep reading my
books, though I'm not sure how much enjoyment I derive out of that. There's
stuff I can do. But it still feels sucky for some reason.
