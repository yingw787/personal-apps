I think the Constitution listed the full Bill of Rights, but this book detailed
some additional context around the creation of the national Bill of Rights,
including arguments posed at the Constitutional Convention, some Federalist
Papers, and the Virginial state bill of rights, which looks rather similar to
the federal bill of rights.

I really like the high order of thought, it definitely comes through around what
the Founding Fathers were thinking. It's pretty hard to find coherent,
long-formed, series-based thought processes these days. I think the ones I've
found might be massive wikis like Wikipedia, some philosophy blogs like Aeon,
and some journalism sources like ProPublica, and if I find other ones I'll
probably pay money for them. It'd be pretty cool to have something like the
Federalist Papers be published again in a major newspaper.
