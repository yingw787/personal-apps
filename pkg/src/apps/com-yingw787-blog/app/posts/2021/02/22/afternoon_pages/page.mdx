Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

This is probably the most adorable video I've seen in a while.

Ohh nooo `$ICLN` why have you forsaken me

It's okay. I ain't no paper-handed bitch. All about those :gem: :open_hands:
:gem: diamond hands babbbyyyy $ICLN to the moooooooon :rocket: :rocket: :rocket:

In all seriousness, I think $ICLN got overpriced because it tripled last year
and people bought in thinking it'll triple this year. It might. But it also
might not and I think the paper hands are folding, maybe as part of a larger
correction. I don't care too much though. Never ever sell stocks that are in the
red. Just wait for inflation to take care of the rest. I wish it declined a bit
before I purchased, or spread out the purchases over time, but who can predict
the future, you know?

I'm finalizing details for the condo, like submitting my earnest money deposit,
purchasing title and homeowner insurance, and doing some other stuff today. So
fun. No actually mind-numbingly boring. Hope to work on my app a little bit
today though.
