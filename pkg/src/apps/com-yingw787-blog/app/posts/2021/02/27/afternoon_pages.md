Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

You know if I keep this babytalk up I won't actually know what the names for
certain things are anymore.

This week went by as a blur. I'm not quite sure why but time seemed to move
faster. I think it might be because of all the meetings I'm in, and the level of
productivity in doing useful work dropping as a result. I do wish I had more
time or mental energy to work on `oneitemstore`, but I don't think it's
appropriate or useful to stress myself out about it. It'll be what it is. In the
meantime, I think I should probably go ahead and do some work for company in
order to make up some hours I probably should have done last week, and maybe
even the week prior. Not sure why things are crazy. I'm still drinking my
coffee. lol.
