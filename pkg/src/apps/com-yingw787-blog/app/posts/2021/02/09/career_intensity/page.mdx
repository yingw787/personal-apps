I purchased this book from Goodwill thinking it'd be interesting. And it was
like $2. Little sad to see the motivational inscription inside knowing the book
was given away.

The book generally talks about ways in order to improve your career. For the
first half, then it kind of rambles on in terms of what you should do to
communicate your personal brand. One of the things I liked about this book was
how they used personal anecdotes in order to carry across a certain message.
There's also business anecdotes as well, that haven't aged as well.

I think if the book was chopped in half and only the first half of the book was
published, I'd put it on my personal bookshelf. As it stands, it's a good
reminder of how important it is to take responsibility for your career.
