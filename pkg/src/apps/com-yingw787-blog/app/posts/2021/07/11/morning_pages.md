The [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic) is pretty
much over for me, but the Morning Poppins group is still going strong (I think).
So here's some of my brief thoughts.

Look baby! Here's a baby!

This is how it starts :heart:

So today I woke up super early for whatever reason. It might have something to
do with the half gallon of concentrated brewed tea I drank yesterday afternoon.
In any case, it's a good opportunity to start the day earlier. It's also quite
possibly the first time I did morning pages the day of and before everybody else
did.

Not quite sure what my day is going to pan out like, but I think I might go for
a run, and then maybe do a little studying at a coffee shop somewhere.
