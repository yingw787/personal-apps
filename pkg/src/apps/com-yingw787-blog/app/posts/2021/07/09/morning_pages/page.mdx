The [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic) is pretty
much over for me, but the Morning Poppins group is still going strong (I think).
So here's some of my brief thoughts.

Oh man oh man oh man. I almost passed out twice yesterday during personal
training and I'm not quite sure why. I went over there, and we were doing these
super-sets with hip hinge on one leg using this bar that attached like a second
class lever, and for whatever reason I felt super dizzy and woozy and I had to
lie down. I felt pretty humiliated, and not just because I'm passing out during
personal training or because I spent however much in order to basically lie
there catching my breath, but also because it's a stark reminder of how I
haven't really been practicing my breathing exercises or doing my cardio the way
I should be.

I really hope I can get my shit in order so that way this doesn't happen again,
but I think it's a process. I did manage to sign up for a gym membership (and
bought a folding kayak), so that's nice and all, but it's still a question mark
in terms of how much I'll be utilizing these resources.
