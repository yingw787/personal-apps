The [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic) is pretty
much over for me, but the Morning Poppins group is still going strong (I think).
So here's some of my brief thoughts.

This is me this morning:

{/_<VideoPlayer
sources={[
{
src: "/video/posts/2021/07/04/morning_pages.mp4",
type: "video/mp4",
},
]}
/>_/}

This is usually me pretty much every morning. LOL

Sad to say but I think now backfilling reports and journals and all the other
stuff I usually did on a day-to-day basis is pretty much the fact of life at the
moment. I am pretty happy that I'm sticking with the routine in general, and
finding a good, solid safety net to fall into, but I need to get back into the
habit of writing a little bit every day.

Oh by the way Happy 4th!!! Imma re-use this flag picture because I think it's
cool:

What's been new recently. This weekend's surprisingly busy. On Friday I went to
get shabu shabu with a friend I haven't seen in one and a half years. Then
yesterday I went to play board games for three hours with the board games club
that I haven't seen in a year or so. Today, I'm going to tour a gym and meet up
with a friend for coffee and celebrate him being hired (because I referred him
to my place and he got hired) before heading over to a BBQ, and tomorrow I'm
going to a second date with a person and rowing on the Potomac. It's
surprisingly packed for a weekend, which is pretty cray-cray because my weekends
are usually not this busy. I'm pretty thankful to see old friends and get to do
more of the activities that I usually did before the pandemic. It is a breath of
fresh air.
