The [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic) is pretty
much over for me, but the Morning Poppins group is still going strong (I think).
So here's some of my brief thoughts.

Heeheehee he looks so done!

Not sure if I want to be Mr. Brown Dog or Mr. Beige Puppy.

Oh man. Today is like my first day off in...how long has it been? Not quite
sure. I've kind of been afraid to take a day off because our team is so small,
but last Friday I snapped at a coworker for recommending one thing over another
and realized that I'm not me without a vacation.

I could definitely use one. This weekend was looooooong. So I didn't realize
that Alexandria, VA was not just Old Town Alexandria but rather a fairly massive
city, so my 7 mile commute turned out to be more like 17 miles. I was commuting
to personal training, which focused on legs. That was on Saturday; then on
Sunday, I went hiking up a mountain with a friend and her friend. So my legs are
like dead and I need to recharge them somehow. I've been wanting to get a
massage for the longest time ever, and maybe now is a good time to get one.

My personal laptop isn't working right now, and so I might need to re-install
Ubuntu on my laptop and pull down everything. It's so friggin' annoying. And the
battery in my iPhone is dying, so I might need to replace my iPhone battery.
That, or I could wait until this winter and heading back to my parent's place,
and then get a new iPhone since the one I have is fairly slow.

I think I also need to try some personal grooming. My shower drain keeps getting
clogged with longer hair and it's really awful to keep pulling out of my drain
filter. If I had shorter hair in certain places, then that wouldn't be much of
an issue. But it's up to me to trim it. So. Yeah. Need to try doing that today.

I think today I'm feeling rather exhausted for whatever reason. It might be the
buildup in fatigue, or it could be since today is a day off, my body is like
_it's okay, you can rest now_ and my entire skeleton groans and sags. Hopefully
it's not like that.
