Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Kitten belly rubs!

I think another life this kitten would make a good swimmer. Don't you?

Hmm, another week of not writing morning pages. I'm getting rather bad at this.
I've been thinking about work a great deal. Not necessarily doing the work,
which would help me not think about work during off-hours, but rather just
thinking about it and spending empty cycles and preventing an ability to
re-charge, which isn't great for work/life boundaries.

I'm almost through Season 1 of "The Crown". It's not bad, but I'm worried about
how much time I'm spending watching TV shows and movies, rather than reading
books like I used to. I need to strike a balance between the two.

Today, I decided to hell with it, I'm going to work on _something_ and then let
that momentum carry me through the rest of the day. This happens to be the
morning pages.

I think during afternoon pages today (which happened to take place during the
afternoon Finisher's Group at the writer's salon), one member mentioned the
extended burnout and how it's important to be nice to yourself. I think I'm
forgetting that to an extent, and I think today is a good occasion to be
reminded of that.
