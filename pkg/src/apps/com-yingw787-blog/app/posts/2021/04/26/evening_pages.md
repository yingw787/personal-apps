Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Oh look, it's a hoodie!

A hoodie made out of your own skin. How convenient.

Today was uneventful. I did manage to chat with a friend until the early hours
of the morning, which meant that I was less rested today than on a comparable
Monday, but somehow I was still productive.

I remember talking about how I saw my life 1/3/5 years ago, and how things
looked a good deal different back then than, and I wasn't sure whether I'm
settling for less than my potential, or just becoming more enlightened. I think
we agreed that this is probably just me freaking out over nothing, and that
sitting back and relaxing was a good change from always being high-strung like I
used to be.

I'm not sure if I mentioned this but I'm hoping to write 1/3/5 year letters to
myself. I think that'll be good in order to get gut checks on where I wanted to
be, really.
