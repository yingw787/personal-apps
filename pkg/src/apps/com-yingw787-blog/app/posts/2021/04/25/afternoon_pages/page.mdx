Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

It's a lean-to!

A very furry, warm lean-to.

So I get a bunch of scam calls from India somehow, they're really annoying, and
I really wished that I stopped getting them.

This isn't what I meant. This is very much _not_ what I meant.

I think given the fractured nature of the response to COVID (still), and the
fact that the cat is out of the bag, we'll probably need booster shots for the
foreseeable future. I'm still practicing decontamination procedures for
everything I bring inside, since who knows how effective the vaccine is against
new COVID variants, but I find it harder to maintain discipline now that I know
there's a safety net.

One thing I am excited about is next week, where I take a Tesla I rented for the
weekend to go over to Shenandoah. I'm not too sure about the specfics, but I'd
like to go over to Big Meadow and sleep under the stars with the panoramic roof.
I'd also like to visit Springfield for [The St. Jame's
Gym](https://www.thestjames.com/) (which is an extremely large and bougie gym),
and Centreville for the Asian food and stuff.
