Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Roooooo!

Man I wish I could stretch like that.

This week I think I'm pacing myself a lot better. I'm still working relatively
hard, but I'm giving myself some breathing room and I think I'm a good deal
happier because of it. I'm also better rested this week, and possibly somewhat
more productive. I think it's a good lesson to be reminded of, that life is a
marathon and not a sprint.

I'm trying out dating apps a bit more. I think Bumble now, and I might see if I
can update my Hinge profile as well. I'm not quite sure how I feel about paying
for apps; if there are free trials, I might give it a shot one day or the next.
I think it might be unhealthy, seeing as it will almost certainly lead nowhere,
but it might be nice to change things up a bit. Otherwise life becomes rather
monotonous.

I still need to figure out what I'm going to do with my Tesla Model 3 rental. I
think I'm going to head over to Big Meadow in Shenandoah and see whether I can
sleep underneath the stars. I might ask whether the Turo owner would be
able/willing to remove the passenger-side seat (or whether that's possible) so
that I can make myself a nice bed with blankets. That'd be pretty sweet. Also
permits and other weird stuff as such need to be cleared before I proceed. I
might want to bump up the rental time earlier in the day, right now I think I
have it scheduled for 5:00PM and moving it earlier doesn't change the cost.

I might want to try and speak at a conference. I know I'm going to at least one
conference later next month, and possibly this week, and I know I need to review
videos and tutorials from Beam college, and it'd be cool to give back and stuff,
you know.

As for the startup idea I'm planning on doing, I don't know what's up with that.
Lack of momentum begets lack of momentum. I'd like to get from "an object at
rest stays at rest" to "an object in motion stays in motion".
