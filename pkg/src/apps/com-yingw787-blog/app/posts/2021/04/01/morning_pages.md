Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Since it's been a little while, wanted to add in more cute videos and photos.
Here's a pupper shaking and rolling over.

Here's a little boy holding a bunch of kittens:

Man, I haven't written here in a while. That's pretty crazy.

Well the move went pretty well, all things considered. I don't think I lost
anything terribly important (because if I did, I do not remember it). I have
around 1-2 boxes left to unpack, which at my current rate means I'll be finished
unpacking sometime by the end of the year, because I've kind of just left the
boxes out there.

For some reason my Internet is behaving really strangely. I'm not sure whether
I'm on a different line than back when I was in my old place (which would be
crazy because I'm just one block over), but I have problems connecting to things
like Google and stuff because of DNS resolution failures. This other time I only
got like 500 bytes a second...when I needed my laptop to play a computer game on
a Windows VM. Very weird, this is pretty fundamental stuff.

I think I'm going to try and cook more frequently. Delivery is so much more
expensive than Trader Joe's, which is so much more expensive than Good Fortune
Supermarket or another Asian grocery store. Like, one delivery paid for an
entire grocery cart full of groceries last time I went in. It's pretty wild and
I should re-orient my brain around what I should be spending for food each
month. Maybe I can add that to my habits somehow.

CERT training is not bad. I still need to do my FEMA courses and such.
