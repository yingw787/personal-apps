Due to the [coronavirus
pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019-20_coronavirus_pandemic), the D.C.
metro region has been in a state of lockdown. To alleviate fear and stress, my
writer's group has put together a daily "morning pages" get-together on Zoom in
order to touch base before starting the day. Here's some of my brief thoughts.

Hehehe, I got the kittie.

I got the kittie.

I don't think I've been writing a whole lot recently. Last week was a bit hard.
I was working, or at least thinking about working, until pretty late into the
evenings, and that took a toll on my level of stress, quality of life, and
ability/willingness to write. I'm trying to nip that in the bud and do some more
writing this week.

The big thing between last week and this week is that I got vaccinated. Against
my parent's wishes, I got the Johnson & Johnson one-and-done vaccine on
Saturday. I kinda got spooked when my former downstairs neighbor said he might
have gotten COVID-19 back in February 2020, back when I was actually skeptical
that coronavirus was going to be a thing. There's really no way to protect
myself while living in a city, in a condo. It's basically just a ticking time
bomb. So I get the vaccine.

Man. It did not feel good at all. I think most vaccines I've gotten feel pretty
good, like I'm usually up and at 'em maybe half an hour after I get it. This
one, nope, you can tell it's rough around the edges. I felt real jet-lagged,
fatigued, like I couldn't keep my eyes open. Also woke up in the middle of the
night quite frequently, I'm talking every hour. I went to bed @ 11PM, and slept
until 3PM the next day, then had headaches and stayed in bed until 7PM. Even
now, a few days later, I have this weird pins and needles feeling that I'm
terrified are quiet blood clots that will get me when I'm 30 or something.

I don't know. Maybe I should have listened to my parents. They're pretty
anti-vaxx in general, and my mom sending over YouTube comments and New York Post
articles did nothing to make me feel better, but they *were* right about the
coronavirus being something to worry about months before everybody else started
freaking out, and maybe they're right about this too.

Well, I got it. So either I'm fine. Or I die alongside hundreds of thousands or
millions of other people. Who knows.
