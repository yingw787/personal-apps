This is the first book I've listened to and finished on Audible! My friend
recommended this book for the drive from North Carolina to Virginia. I was
incredibly sick of listening to the same 15 to 20 songs on my Spotify playlist
over and over again, so I acceded even though audiobooks were never my forte
before. Turns out, it's different if you're driving and you're a captive
audience and you can't turn it off.

The book is a science fiction piece around the sun dimming, and a "hail mary"
solution is launched in order to find a solution. There's a lot of ups and downs
during the journey, but overall strong vibes of friendship, science, and
survival.

Honestly, the book reminds me of some old Gary Paulsen books I used to read as a
kid. The narrator and special effects the audiobook have are a real advantage
over the paper book if used correctly. I couldn't stop listening, I started
doing chores so I'd have an excuse to put on my headphones and do something with
my hands and body and focus on the spoken word.

The spoken word. It's a weird thing to type out. I'm in work meetings all the
time, and I hear people say things, but very rarely do I hear an animated voice
tell a story from cover to cover. It reminds me of the old days, like "Brother
Bear" old days, where people gathered around the fire after a hard day surviving
and listened to the elders speak ancient stories about the stars or some shit
like that. It's good stuff. Good shit.
