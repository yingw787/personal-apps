I picked up a copy of this book when I realized I needed to upskill in the field
of building data lakehouses, given that's the direction the team I'm on is
heading towards. I don't know too much about how data lakehouses work, and I
thought this book would help me out here.

LOL nope. I still don't really know how data lakehouses work. Most of what I've
gleaned is that a data lakehouse is a data warehouse that sits on top of a data
lake. Otherwise, it's a lot of fluff, going off in different directions to try
and cover too many topics in an abstract yet sort-of prescriptive kind of way.

I think it's really hard to write authoritatively about data warehousing. I
recognize the writing style from my older roadmapping documents a few months ago
before internalizing (at least for ICs) strategy should be in service of
implementation. Given that, I would have appreciated if Bill had written about
an abstract data lakehouse architecture in action (e.g. for an e-commerce store
selling product $PRODUCT). I think on one hand, the lack of detail (because by
the time most companies put together a data team, the engineering stack is so
complex that a data warehouse is a really custom piece of architecture) lends
itself to job security. At the same time, the lack of standardization for data
warehousing makes it difficult to compare and contrast what is or should be an
industry best practice, and makes it less "engineer-y" than I would personally
like.

I'll see if there's any other books on data warehousing to read, but if not,
there might be a great opportunity to write one up on how a data warehouse would
proceed in practice.
