I stopped filling out my financial ledger this year. It was probably evident
after I didn't file a financial report last year. It was just too much work
(spending maybe a few hours at a time looking through my credit card statements,
banking statements when I'm changing up credit cards and adding banks I'm using)
for not enough payoff (while I do get to practice my handwriting and look at my
finances deeply, I can't scan through multiple pay periods to see how my
spending habits are changing and whether I'm actually properly budgeting).

So instead I switched over to [Mint](https://mint.com). Yes it's Intuit and the
dark side, and yes I also paid for Mint Premium which costs $5 per month (I'll
go ahead and say it so you don't have to, BOOOO), but it's _so_ helpful from the
analytics angle. I get to see my monthly spending trends (compared to the
previous month), my net worth, a full breakdown of all statements, transactions,
and aggregations, which helps with how I should think about budgeting.

---

Here are some of the major spend items that popped up immediately on Mint:

- Total spending over last 6 months: $37,660.98
  - 31% spend on home (almost entirely HOA fees and mortgage)
  - 17% spend on food & dining (around $6,357.42, on restaurants and groceries
    and such)
  - 16% spend on shopping (around $6,004.69, mostly on Amazon and Costco)
  - 13% spend on health & fitness (around $5,023.24, mostly personal training
    and therapy)
  - Remaining 23% on bills, auto, travel, donations, etc.

---

Here's some notable trends in terms of spend and income I had over this year:

- **I spend a fairly low % on my mortgage + HOA:** If I'm looking at % of my
  total take-home, it's around 16.2%. I think 28% is the recommended mortgage to
  take-home income ratio. The HOA fees get me though, and I think my escrow
  account was running a bit low so the mortgage servicer bumped up my payments
  or something. In general though, I consider myself incredibly lucky.

  I was at one point considering paying down my mortgage early, so I just don't
  have to worry about making payments on a property. Given how my mortgage rate
  is 2.25%, and inflation's averaging @ 7-9% for most of this year according to
  [this table](https://www.calculator.net/inflation-calculator.html), I think
  it's in my best interest to stretch out my mortgage payments for as long as
  possible, since I'll be paying back the bank in dollars that are worth less.
  From looking at Zillow and seeing base rent be $2k / month for units in my
  neighborhood (with no sign of rents slowing down soon), I got a really good
  deal that'll benefit me for years to come.

- **I spend a shit-ton on food and shopping:** I honestly thought that the
  therapy and the personal training would be the most expensive things I spend
  money on, but nope. I spent a ton of money on eating out, Factor75 (this
  fitness-based meal planning service I've been using for a few months), Amazon,
  and Costco. It's not a bad thing necessarily, but if I want to save I have
  oodles of opportunity to do so by cutting spend in these areas (and eat
  healthier and be more financially responsible too).

Overall, there's a general theme I'm noticing around settling into a lifestyle
that suits my income. Currently, I save around half of my income, but it sure
doesn't feel that way given what's happening in the market. I feel sufficiently
motivated to change my spending habits, or I'll be living paycheck to paycheck.

Those are a smattering of high-level observations. So now what does my financial
planning broadly look like, going into a year where 90% of people expect an
economic recession? To put it bluntly, it means figuring out ways to optimize my
spend. After speaking with a corporate-provided certified financial planner from
OneEleven, we came up with the following action items:

- **Cash out any investments I'm not confident in:** I think most of my
  investments, though down for the year, are pretty solid. Large cap **$SWLGX**,
  index **$SWTSX**, dividends **$SCHD** and **$JEPI**, and emerging market for
  batteries **$LIT** are all decent, to say nothing of my 401k accounts. The
  only questionable investment I've made is Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, the
  robo-advisor account I put $17k in. The CFP mentioned there's the risk of
  over-diversification using tools like robo-advisors, where you get exposed to
  too much risk and not as much reward as a traditional index fund.

  So I cashed that out to take advantage of tax-loss harvesting, and we'll see
  what my deduction looks like for next year. In the meantime, I transferred all
  that cash into my high-yield savings account.

  Given the current APY, I should be getting around $94.62 per month in my
  savings account and a liquid 6-month rainy day fund, which could stretch
  further if necessary by cutting expenditures to the bone. Not bad, $1200 from
  interest next year assuming I don't make any withdrawals from that fund and
  interest rates hold steady, and a tax deduction on a $2k loss. It also means I
  don't have to aggressively save, and can instead aggressively invest $3k per
  month into e.g. SCHD and SWTSX. It sounds like making the best out of a bad
  situation.

  - [x] Liquidate Schwab Intelligent Portfolios brokerage account and deposit
        savings
  - [x] Set up a schedule of depositing $4,000 into brokerage accounts each
        month, $2,000 in $SWTSX and $2,000 in $SCHD.

- **Cut out any prepared foods and look more into cooking next year:** I asked
  my CFP if $600 per month for one person is a reasonable food budget, and he
  went **_NOOOOOOOOO_**. In comparison, he spends around $500 per month feeding
  a family of five. So yeah, I really need to cut down on my food spend. But
  how? I _hate_ cooking most times. I cook mostly for special occasions, like
  parties and dates. Usually when I cook it's pretty terrible LOL.

  So that's why I purchased a sous vide machine, a vacuum packer and bags, and
  an air fryer. I've been sous viding chicken using these resusable bags and a
  hand pump, but I can't wash the insides of the bags properly and I got sick
  the last time I ate the chicken. So um yeah nope, going to lower my activation
  energy by using the vacuum packer instead. **I'll need to budget a few hours a
  week to go to Costco and vacuum seal some chicken breast, rosemary, salt, and
  pepper every week or two weeks**. Then I can buy some pre-chopped brussel
  sprouts from Trader Joe's and then toss that into the air fryer every day. Add
  some quinoa in the rice cooker, and voila, healthy meal with very very little
  effort. If it gets boring, I can purchase a spice rack in order to bring out
  my spices from the kitchen cupboard, and maybe try some different things each
  time (instead of rosemary, maybe Old Bay or the steakhouse seasonings).

  - [x] Set up a schedule every two weeks of going to Costco, purchasing chicken
        breasts, and vacuum sealing with salt + pepper + other seasonings before
        freezing.
  - [x] Add in a habit in my new year's resolutions of using my air fryer and
        rice cooker to make brussel sprouts and quinoa more often.
  - [x] Withdraw $100 a month for coffee (using a cash budget reduces the ease
        and increases the pain of spending money on luxury items like coffees).

- **Max out my HSA:** So apparently, I can pay for my therapy costs using HSA
  dollars instead of after-tax dollars. That's $3,850 I could be spending
  before-tax vs. after-tax. Since it rolls over, and provides health benefits by
  retirement, my CFP said it's pretty much a stealthy IRA, and there's
  documentation on the Internet to back that up. So that's an easy dunk.

  - [x] Configure Zenefits to max out my HSA.
  - [x] Change my therapy provider to use HSA funds instead of debit card.
  - [x] Consider looking into maximizing FSA funds (which reset every year and
        do not roll over) if funds for therapy are insufficient.

- **Separate out any business expenditures if there are any into a separate
  banking account:** I was chatting with my CFP around my business ideas and he
  asked if I separated out my business expenditures from my personal
  expenditures. I told him I didn't and he said that'll be really inconvenient
  come tax season, because you'll have to sort out which expenses are personal
  and which expenses are for business. He said if I keep them separated out,
  then I can just keep it separated and then load it all at once into
  QuickBooks for an accountant to take care of.

  I strongly doubt I'm going to go all out in terms of getting a business bank
  account and all that, because I strongly doubt I'm going to get any VC funding
  based out in the D.C. area working on some tiny app.

  - [ ] Apply for a AmEx Blue Business Cash card, and tie it a "business" (i.e.
        NOT personal) checking account.
  - [ ] Switch over payments for "business" expenditures to AmEx Blue Business
        Cash.
  - [ ] While I'm at it, apply for an AmEx Blue Cash Preferred card, I get 6%
        cash back on supermarkets.
  - [ ] While I'm at it, close out my AmEx Gold card (I have no idea how to
        maximize my usage of points) and switch over credit cards to Blue Cash
        Preferred.
  - [ ] Max out my usage of points on AmEx Gold
