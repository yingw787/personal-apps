I stopped filling out my financial ledger this year. It was probably evident
after I didn’t file a financial report last year. It was just too much work
(spending maybe a few hours at a time looking through my credit card statements,
banking statements when I’m changing up credit cards and adding banks I’m using)
for not enough payoff (while I do get to practice my handwriting and look at my
finances deeply, I can’t scan through multiple pay periods to see how my
spending habits are changing and whether I’m actually properly budgeting).
