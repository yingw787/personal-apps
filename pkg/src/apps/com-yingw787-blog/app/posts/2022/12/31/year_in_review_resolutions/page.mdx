Wow, where did the year go?? I feel like I was just staring at a clock that had
freely spinning hour and minute hands! It's crazy. I'm almost 29, which is
almost 30.

If there was a theme for this year, it's probably relaxation and reflection. I
don't think I grew much professionally at all, but personally I grew a good
amount:

- I took part in [PlatoHQ](https://www.platohq.com/) at work, which is a
  networking and mentoring opportunity with engineering and product leaders. I
  took 40 calls in maybe six months, to the point where apparently the CEO of
  Plato was asking who I was (making the most of it LOL).

- I started fostering a cat after my birthday (her name is Kate and she's the
  sweetest thing **EVER**), and after some initial things to work out, we're
  doing okay.

- I took my first vacation longer than a week since I graduated, by going to LA
  and Hawaii with two good friends (Maui was absolutely **GORGEOUS**, and
  Waikiki **OMG**).

I also got into audiobooks! I always fall asleep while driving so my friend in
North Carolina recommended audiobooks as a way to stay awake. I think the key
takeaway from audiobooks is they're so easy to _reread_ to truly solidify my
understanding. I've listened to "The Confidence Gap" around five or six times
through already, and I think I might do the same for "Atomic Habits".

Here's the full list of audiobooks I've listened to in 2022:

- "A Promised Land", by Barack Obama
- "Greenlights", by Matthew McConaughey
- "The Practice of Groundedness", by Brad Stulberg
- "Young Rich Widows", by Kimberly Belle et al.
- "Project Hail Mary", by Andy Weir
- "Promise Me, Dad", by Joe Biden
- "Dune", by Frank Herbert
- "Matterhorn", by Karl Marlantes
- "The Confidence Gap", by Russ Harris et al.
- "Start Small, Stay Small", by Rob Walling (a reread from previous years)
- "Atomic Habits", by James Clear (a reread from previous years)

That's not including the list of books I've read through, which isn't much if at
all. I think I'll continue to listen to audiobooks in the new year, but that's
neither here or there, so why don't we get right to the New Year's Resolutions
and how we did.

- **<span style="color:red">Visit a foreign country (DOES NOT MEET
  EXPECTATIONS)</span>**

  This ended up not being a huge priority for me, so it's okay I didn't visit a
  foreign country. I think the world is still looking to get over COVID, and
  given how it might be year 3 out of 5, it might still be raging for a little
  while longer. Going to Hawaii for two weeks, and being able to see Jon in
  Dallas early this year and visiting Los Angeles for the first time more than
  made up for it.

- **<span style="color:green">Look for a significant other (MEETS
  EXPECTATIONS)</span>**

  I ended up doing it this year, I got a girlfriend! We broke up like a month
  after we became exclusive, but I learned to kiss without a YouTube tutorial,
  learned to lean on somebody, and enjoyed quality time together, all trappings
  of a relationship. I told my parents about her a month in and they DID NOT
  like her at all (mostly around appearance), and did their best to try and
  break us up. I kept them away but became overly afraid and clingy and a
  doormat and that did me in; people can smell desperation. Also, she cared
  deeply about things I didn't care about, and I cared about things she didn't
  care about, so it might have been for the best anyways. Next time, I might
  wait 6 months before mentioning anything.

  The breakup itself was simple, but not easy. It took around 5 minutes and I
  had to pay $8 in parking (we broke up at the National Portrait Gallery and I
  parked at Gallery Place :expressionless:). I thought I'd never get over it,
  but surprisingly enough the really heavy part took around 2 days (made sure to
  get out of the house, do chores, and meet friends), there was a long tail of 2
  months of sadness, and now I think I'm okay. It's a world of change from
  before, and I think the key difference is I didn't hold a torch or cling to
  some pedestal for this person. It's _quite literally_ just another numbers
  game, like investing when the market's down or job searching or anything like
  that.

  Now that I am better established, I think I'll tolerate less bullshit in
  dating. For example, now I get spooked now if people have a mean or sad streak
  in them, or if they respond to my prompts in one-word answers. I'll also have
  to work to be less of a doormat, and confront my partner about things I don't
  like in frank, explicit communication. For example, my ex used to dump her
  worries about passing the bar on me, and then when she passed the bar like I
  said she would, she celebrated with her friends and told me that she just
  wanted to forget about it. I felt it was unfair but didn't say anything
  because I didn't want to rock the boat. Now I'm like if they're gonna leave if
  you're a doormat anyways, _why hold back_? And the great thing about emotional
  journeys (vs. intellectual journeys) is that lessons learned are oftentimes
  _very quickly_ internalized, so I shouldn't have to write this down in a
  notepad to remember to do this.

  I'm not sure whether I'll be pushing on this front in terms of writing up a
  New Year's Resolution, but I'll probably be pushing on this front every day,
  even if I don't expect to have or make time for a relationship due to working
  on a side hustle. If I do so consistently and maintain my mental psyche while
  doing so, I should be able to get into another quality relationship by the end
  of this year. It'll probably take around 3-4 more quality relationships before
  I find the person who I might marry. It takes a lot of time and a lot of
  patience.

  In any case, this was by and large the final frontier of regular stuff I
  haven't cracked, and I cracked it. It doesn't seem so terrifying anymore, and
  that's exactly what I wanted to get out of this. So woohoo!

- **<span style="color:orange">Work towards goals in powerlifting (PARTIALLY
  MEETS EXPECTATIONS)</span>**

  You can read and watch all about it in [my other blog post on
  fitness](/posts/2022/12/31/year_in_review_fitness), but I got pretty far in
  just a few months and then just stopped growing at all for another half year.
  I need to be _consistent_, around not just showing up on time to personal
  training (something I've struggled with), but also showing up for myself in
  going to the gym by myself twice a week and eating right _consistently_.

  I have the tools and I know what it's like to be in a flow state when it comes
  to fitness, I just need to be consistent about it. That's probably the hardest
  part. The good news is, I know enough about getting into a flow state for
  fitness where I can reduce the amount of willpower or motivation I need to get
  back into the flow if I'm ever out. Honestly, my body gets that same itching
  sensation if I don't go to the gym often enough (like when I see a mountain I
  haven't climbed yet) where I'm less worried about breaking my flow state.

- **<span style="color:red">Get 10 customers for side hustle (DOES NOT MEET
  EXPECTATIONS)</span>**

  Though not for lack of trying. At the beginning of this year, I asked a friend
  from work to try and help me out by hopping on a call every week and seeing
  how things are going on my startup. I let him down, and didn't ship anything.
  Fast forward to a few months in and I got into YC startup school, and got some
  matches for startup founders, and got to YC interview stage (!!). I committed
  to one and didn't really do a whole lot because I was in a relationship and
  didn't make the startup a priority. I asked to leave after my cofounder put up
  a challenge, and now I'm back at square one. Now I'm chatting with a
  now-friend who's starting his second company, and looking to make decent
  progress on a weekly basis by running some mom tests and creating Figma
  designs.

  I think honestly I work better solo. I just have an incredibly hard time
  trusting a partner and knowing what to expect, that I'd almost feel more
  comfortable just doing it myself. Of course, that means actually, you know,
  _doing_ it instead of just talking or strategizing about doing it. I have been
  able to write some code, such as [a BigQuery dialect for
  `sqlglot`](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot/pull/204), but haven't been able
  to write apps or systems quite yet.

  That's the thing, knowing what to do at any particular moment, especially
  given huge time constraints if I'm not going to leave my current job (which
  I'm currently clinging onto in the face of economic recession).

  I'll be carrying this forward for next year, I think starting my own
  revenue-generating app is the new final frontier for me.
