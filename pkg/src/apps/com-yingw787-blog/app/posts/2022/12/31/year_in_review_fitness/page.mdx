I haven't really been keeping track of my fitness calendar like in previous
years. It's mostly a consistency thing, coupled with the knowledge I haven't
been disciplined about my diet and therefore shouldn't expect any positive
changes. I did weigh north of 205 pounds earlier this year when I was with my
ex, but after we broke up I dropped like 20 pounds, so I'm around 185 pounds or
so.

I think I set a goal for myself of being around 170 pounds, but mostly with a
low body fat percentage. That's not a system though, and I think I'll look to
describe some dieting and nutrition habits for myself in this year's
resolutions.

Originally during my New Year's Resolutions I had set a goal for myself to meet
some powerlifting PRs. I made good progress during the year on those, and I'm
excited to present some results.

Bench:

- 2022 New Year's Resolution: **429 pounds x 1 rep**
- 2022 year-end deadlift PR: **315 pounds x 1 rep**
- Proof:

Some observations:

- **The squat and bench PRs were made April of this year.** Yup, I didn't make a
  whole lot of progress after my Hawaii trip until maybe October. That's a
  _long_ period to go without making progress. Maybe next year, I'm not going to
  take a 4 week vacation. At least without using the hotel gym or something.

- **I ate very poorly:** A lot of times for personal training, I only ate some
  popcorn for dinner the night before. Yup. The results kind of showed. This cut
  deeply into my ability to make gains during my personal training sessions. I
  didn't start seriously tracking my macros until maybe November of this year.

  I should be detailing this in my New Year's Resolutions.

- **I didn't exercise on my own on a regular basis:** If I didn't have my
  personal training sessions, I would have fell off the map in March. Definitely
  after my Hawaii trip in June. I didn't go to the gym by myself some months,
  instead of the twice weekly by myself like my trainer had asked me to, and I
  didn't walk 10,000 steps a day.

  My cardio is noticeably shit, and personal training doesn't really focus on
  that. I have found that watching movies or TV while on the cycling machine
  really helps me out here, I can work up a sweat and watch some episodes of
  Netflix or something there. I did watch all of "Andor" Season 1 during
  Thanksgiving, which I was really happy about.

  - [x] Combine TV watching with using the cycling machine at the gym.

So what's changed:

- **Going back to visit my parents in Michigan:** It's so incredibly boring.
  Most people I haven't stayed in touch with, most people I've stayed in touch
  with have moved out of state, and I'm not around enough in order to make new
  friends (I come for a week during Thanksgiving and Christmas). So I signed up
  for Anytime Fitness down the street. The gym owner charges $40 cash for the
  week. The relatively high price, combined with having nothing really to do,
  means I go very often, sometimes 4 or 5 times a week. That _really_
  kickstarted my gym routine when I went back home.

  Also my parents are good cooks, and they eat very very healthy. I shouldn't
  take them for granted.

  - [x] Consider going home once a week every quarter for a "pit stop".
