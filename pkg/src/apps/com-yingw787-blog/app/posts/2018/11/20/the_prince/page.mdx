I've been reading "Introductions to Algorithms, Third Edition", and given how
it's about 1200 pages long it's going to take quite a while. Since Thanksgiving
break is this week, I decided to start interweaving some other books into my
reading routine as I have more time. I picked up "The Prince" as it was a
cheaper reprint on Amazon, and started reading it on the plane ride home to
Michigan.

"The Prince" is a surprisingly and delightfully short read, and I think a lot of
what's been written about it is quite true. Machiavelli detailed to his lord
what he would need to do in order to ensure his Princedom prospers, and it's not
things a nice man would do. What did seem rather surprising to me was how
similar "The Prince" was to other books I have read, such as ["The 48 Laws of
Power", by Robert Greene](/posts/2017/12/29/laws_of_power), ["From Third World
to First", by Lee Kwan Yew](/posts/2017/11/15/books_ive_read_this_year), and
even "The Federalist Papers" by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay
(I started reading them and haven't finished so there is no review). Machiavelli
does not do soporifics and he does not do hysterics. He creates arguments based
on evidence and reasoning. He appreciates the limitations of the Princedom model
of governance and mentions, with Machiavellian jealousy, some benefits of the
Republic model of governance, such as the arming of citizens, the sense of
national identity, and the distributed nature of political power.

Hard times make hard men. Italy in Machiavelli's time was a combustible mixture
of fiefdoms, made more combustible by foreign interference. I see the potential
usefulness of Machiavelli's thinking, but it does strike me as a tad desperate.
Those who are blessed with plenty (such as us living in republics today) may
have the benefits of thinking bigger. Those who live in our time and don't, such
as the character in the above quote, will come across as small-minded.
