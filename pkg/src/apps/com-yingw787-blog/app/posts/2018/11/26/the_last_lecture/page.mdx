Pausch, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon, says goodbye to his
family in this book, while giving the rest of us some parting thoughts on how to
live a fulfilling life. The book reminded me a lot of ["Be
Happy"](/posts/2017/12/17/be_happy), as both are anthologies of short stories.
Pausch's comes across as more authentic and relatable, since for him it is a
personal journey. There were a number of takeaways from the book I found
valuable:

- **Live the life you want.** Pausch mentions how he and his spouse Jai may
  not have taken as many vacations when they did if he had more time. This
  point reminded me of the ["financial independence, retire early", or
  FIRE](https://twocents.lifehacker.com/the-basics-of-fire-financial-independence-and-early-re-1820129768),
  and their constant admonitions to _first_ live the life you want before
  trying to develop the capital and cash flow to support it, since you only
  live each day once, and you don't want to find out years later that you
  never got to live your life. I can't speak for others, but one distinct
  problem that I currently have is that _I don't know what life I want for
  myself_, and that prevents me from living the life I want (as I want
  everything and nothing at the same time).

- **Create sharp memories.** Pausch had three young children at the time of
  his death, and he wanted to impart some memories into their minds, where
  memories may be fuzzy. As his oldest son liked marine life, he took him to
  swim with dolphins. Swimming with dolphins, especially as a young child, is
  an unforgettable experience, and hopefully somewhere in that memory will be
  his dad. I think this is pretty great advice for everybody, to think of what
  types of memories we wish to create.

- **Think of the positives.** As a STEM professor, Pausch mentioned being
  highly analytical about his terminal diagnosis, even counting the number of
  cancer tumors on his liver. To me it was either that or it was perhaps an
  out-of-body experience to know you are about to die. Even so, Pausch lived
  with great dignity, with others (including a police officer who stopped him
  for speeding) to comment on how vitally he lived his last days.

  Many of us hear about how when somebody we love dies, a part of us goes with
  him. One well-wisher mentioned how the Indian spiritual leader Krishnamurti
  spun this statement around, saying part of us goes to accompany them, so
  that they will not be alone. This reassuring, optimistic nature is
  constantly present in the book; Pausch provides this father figure very well
  in this book for his kids.
