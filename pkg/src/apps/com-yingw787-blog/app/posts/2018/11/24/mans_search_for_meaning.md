This quote aptly describes Frankl's "autobibliotherapy", or his story of how his
time spent in _four_ Nazi concentration camps helped sharpen his
psychotherapeutic techniques. Frankl, who turned down an American visa offer
before the war started to be with his elderly parents, forced himself to live by
thinking of reuniting with his pregnant wife (who died in the camps) and
lecturing on surviving the camps after the war was over. With those techniques
(and quite a bit of luck and guile), he survived and went on to pioneer the
technique of _logotherapy_, or the idea that people are driven to find some
meaning or purpose in life.

As a meditation practitioner, I can really see how his experiences lend credence
to his later arguments on logotherapy as opposed to meditation for mental and
emotional health. The best teachers are not geniuses who naturally comprehend
all the material, but rather those who do not and have to force themselves
through to that goal. This makes them relatable to ordinary students and gives
the teacher valuable perspective and empathy to pass on. That Frankl's belief in
logotherapeutic techniques only strengthened during his time in the camps, after
everything else was stripped away from him (including the manuscript for his
book), gives us hope that logotherapy will work for our (much more minor)
sufferings and experienced injustices as well.
