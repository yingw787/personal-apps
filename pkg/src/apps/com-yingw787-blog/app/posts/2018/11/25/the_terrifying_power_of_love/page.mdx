When I first read this sentence years ago, I thought, *of course the bad guy
would say this. This is the only way to rationalize his actions. Since he loses,
he must be wrong.* To my kid brain, the fact that the author wrote in the
villian's demise played into my belief into the simple, black-and-white world
part of us all yearn for: that there is a good side and a bad side, with good
people winning and bad people losing. Of course this is the way it is. Of course
this is the way it should be.

Everyone knows this isn't the case. You see your heroes become villians, your
villians complete heroic tasks, and the black and white separation diffuse into
many shades of gray, with the barrier between the two disappearing underneath.
If you aren't ready for this change, like me, you may wonder why if hatred has
not disappeared, whether there is a place -- maybe even a useful place -- in it
in our world and for ourselves. Not a renunciation of good or good acts, but an
*equitable balance* in our hearts between the two.

There is not. Not even close. Not even in the sense that hatred corrupts and can
never be part of a balance, but that love beats hate up, down, and sideways for
Sunday brunch. Since it isn't, we should merely content ourselves with
understanding hatred (where it comes from, how it manifests, and how to stop
it), and otherwise purge it from our hearts.

I had a number of rough drafts around this topic, but I don't think I had a
convincing way to express the difference -- and the gulf -- between love and
hate before I read [Viktor Frankl's
autobiography](/posts/2018/11/24/mans_search_for_meaning). He makes the argument
in a much more succinct manner than I imagined.

Frankl was sent to Auschwitz with his friend, with him going one way and his
friend (quite) another:

> I inquired from prisoners who had been there for some time where my colleague
> and friend P--- had been sent.
>
> "Was he sent to the left side?"
>
> "Yes," I replied.
>
> "Then you can see him there," I was told.
>
> "Where?" A hand pointed to the chimney a few hundred yards off, which was
> sending a column of flame up into the grey sky of Poland. It dissolved into a
> sinister cloud of smoke.
>
> "That's where your friend is, floating up to Heaven,"
> was the answer. But I still did not understand until the truth was explained
> to me in plain words.

I don't think there are any better understood and accepted examples in this
world of hatred than the Holocaust. [In a world where hatred is cheap and love
is
expensive](https://aeon.co/ideas/what-did-hannah-arendt-really-mean-by-the-banality-of-evil)
, where dying is easy and living is hard, Frankl clung to life by clinging to love:

> I did not know whether my wife was alive, and I had no means of finding
> out...but at that moment it ceased to matter. There was no need for me to
> know; nothing could touch the strength of my love, my thoughts, and the image
> of my beloved. Had I known then that my wife was dead, I think that I would
> still have given myself, undisturbed by that knowledge, to the contemplation
> of her image, and that my mental conversation with her would have been just as
> vivid and just as satisfying.

Love is terrifyingly powerful because it exists even in the greatest darkness.
Where hatred is motivated by greed, rebellion, sadism, or any other external
factor, to love another is its own reward. No power on earth can compel love to
behave a certain way, to think a certain way, or to grow or ebb in its strength.
As love extinguishes hatred, hatred can only quench and temper love. To love is
to live, and to live is the purpose of humanity.
