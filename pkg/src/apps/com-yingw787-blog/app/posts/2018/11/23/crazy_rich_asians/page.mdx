**WARNING: Potential spoilers ahead.**

Any book that you can finish in one day is indeed a good book. So let me just
say that I couldn't put this book down.

"Crazy Rich Asians" details the story of Rachel Chu, an economics professor at
NYU who falls in love with a history professor at the same school. He neglects
to tell her some things about his family in Singapore, so when they go over
there for his best friend's wedding, she's surprised to discover that he's
rich...very rich...Illuminati rich. The problem with being Illuminati rich is
that the wealth, passed through multiple generations, goes to people's heads.
This is clear when Rachel is shunned and hazed by people she's supposed to be
able to call family.

What's really great about this book is that it's multiple narratives weaved into
one. Not only do you see Nick and Rachel, but you also see secondary characters
Astrid Leong and Michael Teo, where the situation is very similar but with
reversed characters (Astrid being the wealthy, aloof one and Michael being the
normal, intimidated spouse). There's even multiple timelines, with Kitty Pong
being the exact type of person Eleanor Leong was so worried about in Rachel,
doing to Bernard Tai what she thought Rachel would do to Nicholas. The author
does an extremely wonderful job weaving these stories together, and tying them
into the same penultimate message: that marrying between different classes
results in a lot of emotional pain.

It's a much happier story than "The Great Gatsby". There are many redeeming
characters, Nicholas being our primary protagonist, but also people like Charlie
Wu, the crazy-rich-but-not-mentally-crazy Asian who had Astrid as his ex-fiancee
(and does something amazing for the man who stole Astrid's heart), and Sophia
Leong, the nurse on the island during Amarita's bachelorette party. There's also
no death or murder, which is a nice plus. I had thought initially this was a
rewrite of "The Great Gatsby", talking about rich people and rich people
problems, and it is in a way; but the last-mile problem of making it relatable
to today's audiences, and communicating _the_ emotionally healthy way to deal
with such stressors, makes this book infinitely more valuable.
