Kahneman earned a Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002, and I say earned after
reading his book, "Thinking, Fast and Slow". It's a masterpiece in understanding
the human psyche and how behavorial psychology ties in with economics.

I took a long time to read this book, in part because of [the identity theft
issue that took up most of
July](/posts/2018/07/28/my_experience_with_identity_theft), and in part because
the book is a little on the dry side. Some of the key takeaways I found were:

- The division of the mind between a "System 1", or the primal,
  fast-calculating, and sometimes-wrong part of the brain, and a "System 2", the
  sentient, slow-calculating, and facts-parsing part of the brain. "System 1" is
  used when snap judgements need to be made (e.g. I'm the prey and that over
  there is the predator), while "System 2" is used to calculate and reason about
  difficult problems (e.g. how to trap a mammoth). The interactions between
  "System 1" and "System 2" produce the combination of rationality and
  irrationality that frustrates classical economics.

- We use diagrams and graphs ("scientific evidence") to lull ourselves into
  thinking we can confidently produce a description of a certain economic
  behavior, but it is not always true. For example, the commonly accepted
  intro-to-economics [law of
  demand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_demand) states how if the price
  of a good rises, the demand for it falls. This doesn't hold true, however, for
  [Veblen goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good) like luxury
  automobiles and [Giffen goods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giffen_good) like
  Irish potatoes. Since people view the price of a Veblen good as a desirable
  trait increase their consumption upon a price increase. At the other end of
  the scale, if the price of a Giffen good increases, those consuming it cannot
  afford to purchase superior goods and must increase their consumption. Another
  example with a better tie-in to behavorial economics is Kahneman explaining
  the change in utility along an [indifference
  curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indifference_curve) depends on the
  history of how you arrived at the state you are at along the indifference
  curve, vis-a-vis [the endowment
  effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect). To me, this was like
  when quantum physicists tell you to throw away your understanding of classical
  physics because it's wrong.

- In the conclusion, Kahneman tells us how to avoid the fallacies and cognitive
  minefields that come with a conscious or unconscious dependency on our "System
  1". Some methods include the use of a wider vocabulary (e.g. as in the medical
  field, where specific medical terms may recall symptoms, diagnoses, and
  effects associated with that term), the use of routines (e.g. pilot pre-flight
  checklists), and attention to statement framing or how you say things.

While this book may be a tad tedious at times, it is full of new ideas that
challenge your existing mode of thinking. Every chapter starts off the way you
may expect and ends in a way you don't.
