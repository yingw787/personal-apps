> Bennett Foddy, in "Getting Over It"

As I begin implementing a lot of my New Year's Resolutions, I have to be prepared to deal with a good amount of rejection and the negative feelings that come along with it. Maybe it's that kind of emotional upbraiding that let me discover this game. Maybe it's because I'm a vile, sadistic, and evil person inside. I'm not exactly sure.

"Getting Over It", Bennett Foddy's newest release, is an exercise in frustration. You play as a very fit man trapped inside a cauldron, who needs to climb to space up an impossibly shaped mountain of random elements using only a Yosemite hammer. There are many places in the game where you can fall and have your progress reset. There's even one place in the game that will take you back to the very beginning.

Here's a picture of the game. This guy was not meant to climb mountains:

Here's a nice video that demonstrates how frustrating the game is, without (much) swearing:

I don't think I could find a completely clean video that also demonstrates how difficult the game is.

I'm not a huge fan of video games these days. I think it's likely because I had a lot of progress in video games back in fourth grade, and I lost all that progress when my PlayStation 2 disappeared. Nowadays I have a hard time justifying to myself the time and expense for video games. I also stare at a screen for long periods of time already, as a developer. Nowadays I mainly read books for fun.

I might get this game though. I want to really see if I have grown as a person over the last year, and judge what I really feel inside as I encounter these obstacles. I think I will know if I don't feel angry or frustrated when I lose progress.

And it's for macOS too, so I really have no excuse :smile:
