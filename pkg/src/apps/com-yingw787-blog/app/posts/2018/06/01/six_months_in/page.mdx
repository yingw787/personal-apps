I _definitely_ cannot believe that that it's June. It feels like I just started
my current job and I'm still afraid of pollen.

I like these quarterly updates. It definitely makes sure I get grounded to a
sense of time, before time makes me an old man.

What's cooking?

- I'm a regular at my company now. My direct manager is pretty awesome and I am
  very lucky to have her. She has both a high IQ and EQ, which are two traits
  much rarer in practice than I thought, and something that I can more fully
  appreciate.

- My project at work chugs along. There are fits and starts here and there
  because I've been iterating my process and trying to get it right. I've gotten
  most of the kinks out, I think, and very soon I can start on that hockey stick
  development curve that makes a project _go_. Refactoring will be a pain, but
  after implementing the initial feature set that will make it "complete", I
  should have time to focus on making it truly great. Ideally, I'll be able to
  open source it (or publish it on GitHub, since it already ships with an MIT
  license) by the next major software suite release in September of this year
  sometime. I am definitely learning how to be an effective individual
  contributor.

- I'm starting to publish on my company's blog! Hopefully I'll publish a
  featured article once a month, and cross-syndicate on my blog and the company
  blog. Maybe I can be the
  [Hazardish](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRxBkZbx2ogxBjvTEV3R6EQ) of the
  technical blogging community.

- I almost have one year's worth of liquid savings! I will likely store away
  that whole amount in some account (maybe with my current bank, maybe with
  another bank) so that I am not tempted to touch it. Then, I think I will
  either save another year's worth of cash in order to bootstrap my own thing,
  or I will begin investing again (either index funds or dividend funds). Or
  both, I don't know.

- I am paying better attention to [the habits that build
  habits](https://zenhabits.net/habitses/). Without tracking my habits, they
  fall through. That included going to the gym, cooking every day, and coding
  every day. So, I bought this app called
  [Productive](http://productiveapp.io/), that kind of mirrors what Calm had
  been doing for me. Instead of having a meditation session, you can add in
  different habits, and it will remind you to do them, set alarms, keep streaks,
  and display analytics. It's $7 for three or four months, and I think it's
  worth it so far. I've lost about 15 to 20 pounds over the past month, going
  from 185 to 165-170, which was unexpected. The UX is a bit unfamiliar, and
  there's some custom functionality that I would prefer it have, but unless I
  build out my own habits app and CMS, I don't have a good comeback.

- I bought a PC at home, and am building out my workstation. It should be
  finished very soon, and I'll complete a writeup about that.

- I am walking. A lot. Arlington is supposedly [the fittest city in
  America](https://www.washingtonian.com/2018/05/14/arlington-is-the-fittest-city-in-america/),
  and you can definitely tell people like running, biking, stand-up
  paddleboarding, and otherwise doing sports. I miss the sunlight. My grandma
  commented on how pasty my skin is, and I'm afraid of losing hair. So the bike
  is in the bike garage and I walk 20 minutes to work.

What hasn't happened this year?

- ...that date I promised myself I'll go on. Now I'm a bit concerned. Like alarm
  bells concerned. I'm not afraid of talking to girls, and I don't think I have
  enough shame or fear of rejection left to ask people out on dates (out of
  general self-apathy and desperation), but I just don't put myself out _there_,
  wherever _there_ is. Dating apps are not for me. I need to trust and be
  comfortable around other people now before I allow myself even the modicum of
  romance. We'll see where this goes. I don't have a roadmap.

- I also don't have too many friends nowadays, and I feel the loneliness. I'm
  like an emperor penguin alone in Antarctica. Most of my friend-interactions
  last year came from my last company. Two things are different now. One, this
  is a normal company where employees respect one another and see a future,
  which means that relationships at work prioritize the corporation. Two, most
  of my coworkers are much older than I am (mid-thirties is on the young side),
  and while I really appreciate the maturity at work, they have responsibilities
  and cannot "hang out" afterwards. I don't think I can do hanging out every
  day, but once a week would be nice. I think this is where the running club
  I've been going to on again, off again will come into play.

- The lack of verbal communications and thinking on my feet on a regular basis
  has definitely impacted me in a negative way. I have difficulty forming
  sentences, and elucidating my scattered thoughts. It's likely a result of me
  working on a siloed, independent project. It could also be who I've always
  been underneath. Maybe I should try out Toastmasters or something.

- I still haven't learned ukelele. It's probably gone out of tune. Again. The
  fiscal conservative in me is going absolutely nuts. Why the _hell_ did I buy a
  ukelele if it's just going to sit there?! I need to add this to Productive,
  and get a stand for it instead of having it pile on my desk.

- I am being a bit more deliberate about my cooking (I baked my own bread last
  weekend because I was afraid of the bread-cake in the store), but it still
  needs work. Maybe make a new dish from a recipe a week?

Adding my New Year's Resolutions list to Productive, and keeping track of
everything, is going to be much more difficult than I thought. That being said,
things aren't bad. I know and appreciate that I'm much luckier than the vast
majority of people in this world, and I am grateful. I just need to make the
most of it.

**(Correction on 2018/06/09)**: A prior version of this post described my
manager as "physically and emotionally intelligent". This is changed to "high IQ
and EQ" after some discussion with a friend as "physical intelligence" may be
ambiguous.
