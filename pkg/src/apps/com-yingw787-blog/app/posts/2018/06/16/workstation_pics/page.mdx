I promised in [a prior post](/posts/2018/06/03/new_workstation) that I'd have a
picture (or two) to show you guys. Without further ado:

Obviously, this is way too clean to be my workstation. So here's an actual
picture after _everything_ has been set up:

Some notes:

- I'm a messy person who is also cheap and requires a lot of instant
  gratification when finding things. Given how plastic tables are cheaper than
  file cabinets, that means I kept a lot of stuff on the three plastic tables I
  count as furniture in my apartment. I didn't want that clutter in my new
  workstation, so I intentionally bought the smallest standing desk I could
  (30'' wide), and put the smallest plastic table I had next to it for my
  "messy" things. There's still a gigantic plastic table behind me that stores
  everything that can't fit onto these tables.

- The plastic table is also really nice because not only do I have my power
  strip and desktop PC on it, I have that [AmazonBasics laptop
  stand](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Ventilated-Adjustable-Laptop-Stand/dp/B00WRDS8H0)
  that I use for a separate computer or book. If I brought back my corporate
  laptop, or needed to do something on macOS using my old MacBook Pro, I can put
  it on this stand, and take the monitor display cables from the PC also on that
  desk and plug it into the laptop instead. This means my monitors are truly
  decoupled from my desktop PC, somethin that couldn't happen if I used a CPU
  holder mounted on the underside of my standing desk. Another example is how I
  have my [AmazonBasics
  speakers](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Twins-USB-Powered-Computer-Speakers/dp/B00GHY5F3K)
  with a speaker jack on my standing desk and my [Amazon Echo
  Dot](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Dot-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-Alexa-Black/dp/B01DFKC2SO)
  on the plastic table. In a pinch, I can connect the speakers from my desktop
  PC to my Echo Dot.

- I have a lot of Amazon stuff.

- Another benefit of this plastic table is everything is kept away from the
  floor, which makes it easier to clean my floor (something I have very little
  incentive to do in the first place). This is partially due to the help of my
  [massive Belkin power
  strip](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000HPX46U/ref=twister_B0774PW9R4?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1);
  12 outlets, a 10'' cable, and power surge protection that serves as the
  central hub of my workstation. I could have gotten an uninterruptible power
  supply in a power strip format with the battery mounted in-place, but I don't
  run any mission-critical systems on my desktop PC and I doubt I will. All I
  need is to make sure my components aren't fried in the next lightning storm.

I'm really happy with my setup right now. Ideally it will remain this way for
the next ten years, or longer.

A great big shout-out to [Fully](https://www.fully.com/), where I got my [Jarvis
electric sit-stand
desk](https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html)
from. The desk works great, it's easy to assemble, and it seems pretty high
quality. The customer service and product support are fantastic; I returned a
CPU holder I got when I realized that it would not fit underneath my standing
desk.
