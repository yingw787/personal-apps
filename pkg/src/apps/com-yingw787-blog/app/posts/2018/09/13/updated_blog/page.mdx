A few weeks ago, I realized that the latest version of
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the static website generator I use for my blog, as
well as [`hugo-minimo-theme`](https://themes.gohugo.io/minimo/), had some
breaking changes. I was meaning to migrate my blog to a newer version of the
theme and framework, but it would have taken me quite a lot of time, time that I
did not have.

So in desperation, I messaged [Munif Tanjim](https://muniftanjim.com/), the
creator and maintainer of the theme, to ask him for help in migrating my blog.
To my great surprise, he replied, and not only did he help me migrate my blog
over, he did it for free declining payment and did it in one day! I am a loyal
follower now and very, very happy with his work. Please go check out his blog,
and make blogs with his theme!
