I finally got around to ordering some business cards, and today they finally
arrived.

Last week, I went to a Y Combinator Q&A session at GiveCampus, an Indie Hackers
meetup, and met somebody at the gym. I could have used business cards for all
three of those occasions, but I didn't have any on me. All I had were the
business cards from my previous company, and there's no way I'm walking around
with those. Not just because I really didn't want to be associated with my
former company anymore, but also because all the contact information was out of
date and I'd have to go and change it. My new company hasn't offered engineers
business cards, and in any event, I wanted to work on my own personal brand.

So I decided to go on [Vistaprint](https://www.vistaprint.com) and create my own
business cards. I went for the cheapest card stock and finish, because all I
really want to do is make sure people don't get my name or contact information
wrong. Then I decided to include all my web-based contact information, but not
my phone number, since it's easy enough to write down and I shouldn't be giving
synchronous methods of communication willy-nilly.

I tried to think of something witty to say as my personal statement. I settled
on "I Do Things, Sometimes". I think this accurately captures what I do. It's
not precise, but it _is_ accurate.

Pricing for business cards is kind of messed up. For \$7.99, you can get 100;
for \$8.99, you get 200, and for \$9.99, you get 500. Economies of scale and all
that. I don't give away that many business cards all that often, so this card
stock is going to stick with me for a while. Hence the choice of personal
statement; if I switch away from being a software engineer a few years down the
line, my business cards are still relevant! And I think my domain will always be
mine, barring any payment interruptions, and so will my LinkedIn.
