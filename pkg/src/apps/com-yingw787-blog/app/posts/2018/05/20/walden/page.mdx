Not everybody goes into the woods, builds a small hut, and lives there for two
years -- so we can safely say that Henry David Thoreau was a special person.
"Walden", a product of that time, is a special perspective into Thoreau's mind.
"Walden" details very much how Thoreau saw _his_ world, and guides us in how we
should see ours.

You can immediately tell that Thoreau lived in a different time. It's not just
that he spells Hindus "Hindoos" and Eskimos (Inuit) "Esquimaux", but the weaving
of an enlightened prose that, despite its verbosity, drives deeply into your
thoughts. It was also a time where you could build a shed for less than one
hundred U.S. dollars, when proprietors cut blocks of ice out of Walden to sell
at market for refrigeration, and you could directly drink out of wells and lakes
without worrying too much about chemicals, microplastics, and general human
taint. A simpler time, if you will.

Thoreau may agree, as during his time in Walden, he more or less lightly dances
to the tranquility bestowed upon his senses. The sense of wonder and joy he
witnesses in his woods is evident in every adjective and verb in "Walden". If
you read Harry Potter, you could say Thoreau treated Nature as his Pensieve; if
it was not his Heaven, it was a window into it.

One unexpected inclusion in my copy of "Walden" was Thoreau's essay "On the Duty
of Civil Disobedience". It was such a jolting thematic change that I googled it
to see why he had included it. He didn't; it was included by the publisher
(without warning), and written after he had been jailed after coming back from
Walden for not paying his poll taxes (a tax for literally existing). This essay,
a fiery rebuke by Thoreau on the society he tried to escape for a time,
highlights and cements a lot of the lessons we learn from him during his time on
the pond. Thoreau hammers home not just the importance of self-reliance, but its
inherent virtue; not just the separation between the state and the individual,
but the right to be forgotten. The contrast between Thoreau's admiration of
nature and his disgust of society is not something I expected to see -- yet it
provides a key piece of his life I did not expect to find. What are we if we
remove our dependency on society and on societial constructs? Thoreau gives us
the timeless answer - we are always what we choose to be.
