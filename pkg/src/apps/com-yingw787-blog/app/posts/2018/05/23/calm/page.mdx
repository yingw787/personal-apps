You remember those [weekly updates](/posts/2018/04/05/weekly_updates) that I promised to start delivering? Yeah, nope, didn't happen at all. I forgot about within the same week I published that post.

On the other end of the spectrum, I have recently completed my 256th daily meditation practice using [Calm](https://www.calm.com/). That's over the course of about a year. Here's a screenshot of some metrics the app shows you after every meditation:

If you told me a year ago that I would have completed my 250th daily meditation in one year, I would have not believed you. Then I would ask you how you got in my apartment. All jokes aside, I myself find this ridiculously incredible. From reading about Calm in [Adrian Rosebrock's blog post about his daily routine](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/01/30/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-adrian-rosebrock-computer-vision-researcher-developer-and-entrepreneur/) to downloading the app and using it during the free trial, to forking out _actual dough on an iOS app as the frugal Luddite I am_, to using it most every day, has been quite the journey, with _tangible benefits_. I've grown much more mindful and at peace with who I am -- not an easy task for me -- which has then helped me in my professional career. It's helped me become more self-aware and fills me in on the things I need to personally improve upon in my life. Most importantly, _it's a habit that acts as a base for all my other habits_: all I need to do is to do, and feel, the same things for all the other routines I want to build up.

So what about Calm is so useful, and how can I translate that to my other habits?

- It's **easy**. It's ten minutes of meditation every day, and it's in your face the moment you open the app.

- It's **trackable**. A calendar pops up after every meditation, and in a separate window, that shows which days you meditated (ten minutes will do) and which days you didn't. As the saying goes, you optimize for what you track.

- It's **consistent**. There aren't any major redesigns or overhauls that slow the app down or confuse you. _Nothing_ has noticeably changed. And for people building up habits, it's one less thing to worry about.

Once upon a time last year, I was so lazy I had to eat red pepper flakes in order to get up and drink some water (I stopped that). Yet I do this thing. I'm a sucker for metrics.

I _highly_, **highly**, **_highly_** recommend Calm. In fact, using any apps like these in order to manage your life -- especially when you're as disorganized as me -- can do wonders for your productivity, your self-esteem, and your outlook on life. I'm also using [Todoist](https://todoist.com/app?lang=en#start) for to-do lists, and [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/a/queue/) for organizing my bookmarks. But definitely get Calm.
