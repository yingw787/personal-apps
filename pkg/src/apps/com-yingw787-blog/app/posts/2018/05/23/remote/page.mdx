"Remote" is a full-throated, yet fair, pitch to employers and employees alike
that there's no better time to have remote working be a part of your business
model.

I think this book is very similar to "Rework", which I [reviewed and deeply
enjoyed earlier this year](/posts/2018/04/04/rework). Large fonts, large
margins, helpful graphics, and bite-size lessons hammer home the point the
authors make and encourage you to finish and re-read. I feel safe to say I'd
recommend any book these guys put out.

Some arguments "Remote" make that I really like include:

- Your software engineers will find more bugs, especially if they work in
  different countries and timezones. If you used Python 2 and forgot to execute
  `from __future__ import unicode_literals`, or if you forgot to `import
tzlocal` and save your datetimes as ISO-8601 format _without a timezone_, or
  if you had some front-end validation logic that only checked for ten-digit
  phone numbers, you may gotten away with it if your users were only local to
  your region -- until you tried to scale your business model to another country
  and found your codebase lagging. If you have employees in a predominantly
  non-English-speaking country, they may have caught this for you, because it's
  native for them. You're inherently future-proofing your application because
  you're developing a product natural to your future customers. For more
  examples, check out this [great list of falsehoods programmers
  believe](https://github.com/kdeldycke/awesome-falsehood).

- Important communications would be written down and communicated in a
  persistent way. I would bet money that one reason so many companies use
  Basecamp is because the peeps at Basecamp _dogfood Basecamp in order to
  survive as a company_. We all want to dogfood our applications, but unless
  every single person at your company is super passionate about the product and
  constructs a regularized routine to do so (and that's _impossible_), it
  doesn't happen as much as it should. I don't think that's the case for remote
  workers. You could hop over to a meeting room, jot down notes on some
  specification honing or requirements tuning, then just start implementing it
  without noting it in your ticket tracker. You could even ask a person
  questions about something following that meeting and not update the ticket at
  all. This can't really happen if a team is working remotely, because nobody's
  sitting next to each other. Everything needs to be tracked if multiple
  developers working on a particular feature must understand the feature. If not
  everything, then at least everything _important_.

- As a parallel to the previous point, more attention is likely to be paid to
  the results of your work if you work remotely, because people track what they
  can measure. You can't judge people based on their times getting in and out of
  the office, because there is no office. You can't judge people based on what
  they're wearing or their body language during meetings, because you can't see
  them. All you really have to go off of is their work, and whatever is tracked
  in their issue tracker. Isn't that the ideal for a good manager anyways?

Jason and David do make some good and valid counterpoints to working remotely.
You need to make sure you stay emotionally and mentally healthy, which means
setting your own routine, getting out of the house, not _overworking_, and
exercising regularly. I know personally I rely on going to the office to help
set my daily routine. You may also need to be extra-visible and
extra-trustworthy to customers, who may be rightly wary of trusting a screen or
prompt instead of a face. If that is no problem for you, though, remote work
could be very empowering. Jason and David make this argument powerful by tying
remote work's advantages to the things that really matter, like spending time
with your children or having new experiences and hobbies in a different
geographic location.
