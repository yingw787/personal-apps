Over the past two years, I learned a good deal about what makes professional
software engineering "professional". Among the most important lessons is
"process, process, process". Make sure your features enjoy short time-to-market,
your development cycle is reliable and reproducible, and your debugging cycles
iterate and improve easily, and if you were going to succeed in any capacity
before, you will (and if you weren't, it wasn't the developer's fault :blush:).
One of the most important things to master on the path of perfecting your
process is development velocity and productivity. This means using tools that
boost developer performance.

Python can help with that.

Python is already a programming language well suited to productivity. It's
interpreted. It's dynamically typed. It has a _huge_ number of up-to-date
libraries. These things, and other features of Python, present themselves to you
when you use Python on a daily basis. But there's still even more tricks you can
employ to make your development even faster.

What if I told you there were not only multiple _versions_ of Python, but also
multiple _REPLs_ as well? Once upon a time, both of these seemed crazy to me.
How could you have multiple versions of a programming language? Then I
implemented [my own version of Lisp in C](https://github.com/yingw787/c-lisp),
and realized that a programming language is just an API to the machine. It's the
_specification_ that counts, not the code.

So, what "flavors" of Python are there, exactly? You have your standard Python,
CPython, which is implemented in C. Then you have
[Jython](http://www.jython.org/), which is Python on the JVM;
[PyPy](http://pypy.org/), which is Python with a JIT compiler instead of an
interpreter; [IronPython](http://ironpython.net/), which is Python written in C#
for the .NET framework, and a number of others. The only other version of Python
I've heard mentioned in a production setting is
[Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/), which is LLVM-optimized and can target CPUs
and GPUs, but I've never worked with it (as of yet).

While I don't use multiple versions of Python in production, I _very much_ do
use different
[REPLs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) for
CPython. Alternative REPLs in Python are extremely useful because as Python is
an interpreted language, how the code is typed is how the code will run, more or
less (for instance, multi-part if statements are evaluated on-the-fly from left
to right). One REPL I constantly use is [IPython](http://ipython.org/). IPython
has several noticeable differences between the regular Python shell, including
syntax highlighting, tab completion, and integrations with MATLAB and
Mathematica. However, the biggest reason I use IPython is for debugging
purposes. Here's the plain Python debugger:

```python
import pdb
pdb.set_trace()
```

<hr style="height:-100pt; visibility:hidden;" />

I've typed the above phrase about ten times in 2 years. By contrast, I've typed
the following phrase hundreds, if not thousands, of times:

```python
import ipdb
ipdb.set_trace()
```

<hr style="height:-100pt; visibility:hidden;" />

This drops you from your Python script into not the Python shell, but the
IPython shell. From here, you can do your `continue`, `next`, `step`, and `up`
commands that you would expect. The _experience_, though, is _so much_ nicer.

Fun fact: IPython formed the basis of [Project Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/),
which recently [won the ACM Software System
Award](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-receives-the-acm-software-system-award-d433b0dfe3a2)
and is _the_ tool data scientists everywhere swear by.

There's also [BPython](https://bpython-interpreter.org/about.html), which
focuses much more on optimizing the experience of the Python interpreter. One
very nice aspect of BPython is that the docstring for the function you are
trying to call appears inline in the terminal. And take a guess at how the
BPython debugger is invoked in a Python script. That's right:

```python
import bpdb
bpdb.set_trace()
```

<hr style="height:-100pt; visibility:hidden;" />

Another very useful feature of Python is the [`dir()` built-in
function](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#dir). `dir()` lists
the attributes of an object in Python, or lists the variables present in the
local scope. If you're playing around with an unfamiliar object, and you're
wondering what "things" you can do with it, use `dir()`.

Let's say you imported the `random` package. You can use `dir()` to find what's
available to you without immediately clicking away to view the static
documentation somewhere else:

```bash
>>> import random
>>> dir(random)
['BPF', 'LOG4', ... 'vonmisesvariate', 'weibullvariate']
>>> random.weibullvariate()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: weibullvariate() takes exactly 3 arguments (1 given)
>>> dir(random.weibullvariate)
>>> ['__call__', '__class__', ..., '__doc__', ..., 'im_self']
>>> random.weibullvariate.__doc__
Weibull distribution.\n\n        alpha is the scale parameter and beta is the shape parameter.\n\n
>>> random.weibullvariate(1, 2)
1.3195979776787314
```

<hr style="height:-100pt; visibility:hidden;" />

This is me learning that the `random` package has a `weibullvariate` method in
about seven lines of code. This would be a good place to exit the shell and use
BPython and its native docstring formatter.

One last trick I would like to demonstrate is how to programmatically convert a
relative path to an absolute path, while still remaining both Python 2 and
Python 3 compliant.

Relative paths are much easier to play around with by hand because you have to
type less; but a quirk in Python trips up computers when they try to read
relative paths. This is because the relative paths (at least in Python) start
from the location of program execution. So if you have a shell script wrapping
your Python script that you are executing somewhere else, the current location
`'.'` will be where the shell script began executing, _not_ where the Python
script is located.

Let's take an example project structure:

```bash
username@hostid:~$ tree sample_project
.
├── some_shell_script.sh
└── tests
    ├── test.csv
    └── test.py

1 directory, 3 files
```

<hr style="height:-100pt; visibility:hidden;" />

And some example files:

<hr style="height:-100pt; visibility:hidden;" />
<p style="line-height: 0.1;">'some_shell_script.sh'</p>
```bash python tests/test.py ```
<hr style="height:-100pt; visibility:hidden;" />

<hr style="height:-100pt; visibility:hidden;" />
<p style="line-height: 0.1;">'test.py'</p>
```python open('./test.csv') ```
<hr style="height:-100pt; visibility:hidden;" />

When you run `sh /path/to/some_shell_script.sh`, you get an error message:

```bash
username@hostid:/path/to/sample_project$ ./some_shell_script.sh
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "tests/test.py", line 1, in <module>
    open('./test.csv')
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: './test.csv'
```

<hr style="height:-100pt; visibility:hidden;" />

This is because the directory containing 'some*shell_script.sh' does not include
the file 'test.csv' -- but that's where \_Python* is looking!

So how do you solve this? Yes, you can use the `pathlib` module that comes
packaged with Python 3.4+. However, I myself have never worked in an environment
that supported only Python 3 yet (and yes, it's _2018_!), so the code I write
must be both Python 2 and 3 compatible.

Here's what I do:

- I wrap the relative path I want relative from my Python file in
  `os.path.relpath`.
- I grab the location of the current directory of the Python file using
  `os.path.dirname(__file__)`.
- I tie the two paths together using `os.path.join`.
- I create the absolute path from that intermediate result using
  `os.path.abspath`.

The final result looks something like this:

```python
os.path.abspath(
  os.path.join(
    os.path.dirname(__file__),
    os.path.relpath('./test.csv')
  )
)
```

<hr style="height:-100pt; visibility:hidden;" />

Of course, you can always abstract the logic away into a separate method, but
you need to pass in both the relative path and call the `__file__` variable in
the Python file you start your relative path from.

Voila! You have a programmatically generated absolute path that works in Python
2 and Python 3!

Thanks for reading! I hope you can apply these tips and tricks to make your
Python development even faster.

In case you wanted to check out more about REPLs, take a look at
[repl.it](https://repl.it). They have a large number of
[languages](https://repl.it/languages) they support.
