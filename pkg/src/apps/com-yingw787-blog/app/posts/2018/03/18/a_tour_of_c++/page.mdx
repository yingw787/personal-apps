At my new company, our core software is all written in C++. Much of this is due
to performance concerns, and because CUDA, the NVIDIA GPU programming platform,
primarily interfaces through C++. I thought to begin reading our C++ code, but
without even a basic understanding of C++ beyond that in college, knowledge
retention and transfer would be a challenge. Hence, my journey to learn C++.

Calling "A Tour of C++" a tour may be disingenuous. The book is jam-packed full
of information and at less than 200 pages, it took me a few weeks in order to
finish, and will take me more time and re-reads in order to fully digest. I
sense that as a software engineer writing Python and JavaScript in a prior life,
understanding C++ will require some getting used to.

A number of interesting things the author notes in the book include:

- "C++ is _not_ just C with additional features on top. C and C++ diverged quite
  early on, and while the two languages influence each other strongly today,
  they are not immediately compatible and best practices do differ
  significantly. You can't just take a C program and compile it as C++, and call
  it a day, if you want to have a good day.

- C++ is not designed by committee or by a programming savant; it was designed
  according to the requirements at multiple points in time. Hence, while C++ is
  decently flexible and wholly relevant, there does not appear to be a unifying
  design philosophy exposed to the user of C++. There's multiple ways to do
  things, with some better than others. With the added complexity of being a
  lower level language, this looks to mean a large amount of intellectual
  overhead.

- The book devotes a great deal of attention to both types and the standard
  library. Again, coming from languages where variables are neither strongly or
  strictly typed, this is a major paradigm shift. The reliance on having a large
  standard library, one of C++'s strengths, as part of all C++ development is a
  little strange to me too (Python has a standard library, but a lot of times
  third-party packages like `datetime` and `requests` are used in their stead).

I will have a lot of learning to do if I am to become a competent C++ programmer
(which I hope to be in some capacity by the time I leave my current company). If
you are coming from a higher-level background, this book will almost certainly
be difficult. However, if you are operating at a low level or know some prior
C++, this book may help you a good deal.
