I think I'm going to start jotting down weekly updates. My personal progress isn't where I want it to be, and maybe publishing every weekend on three to five things I did that week to make myself better would be helpful in keeping track of my progress throughout the year.

I'm thinking:

  - One reading-related (book reviews)

  - How many days I meditated (according to Calm)

  - How many days I exercised (according to Sworkit/agenda)

  - How productive I was (according to Timing)

  - (If applicable) one fitness-related

  - (If applicable) one coding-related

Out of all the motivational shticks I've seen, one has stuck with me:

$$ 1.01^{365} = 37.78 $$

$$ 0.99^{365} = 0.03 $$

I want that 1%.

Also, this is my one year anniversary on this blog. [This was my first post](/posts/2017/04/05/first_post). Damn.
