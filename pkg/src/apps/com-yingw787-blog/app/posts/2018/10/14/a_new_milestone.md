Things I've learned:

- **My productivity app subscription** has easily paid off dividends. I don't
  think I would have achieved this streak without continued automated reminders
  on my phone.

- **Strangely enough, I'm not anxious to keep this going**. I lost streaks in
  the past by being agitated and internally blamed myself. I stopped doing that
  and ironically my streaks have gotten longer.

- **Meditating early in the day helps me remain focused and calm during business
  hours**. As stress from work has been increasing, I moved my meditation
  session from super late in the evening (like 11:45 PM late) to right after I
  get in. It helps with being able to focus and remaining calm while working
  with coworkers, dealing with requests, and take care of other business-related
  stress.

:wine_glass: -- To the next 100 days!
