This book was a short but remarkably good read about how to optimize for your
impact in your career. After working professionally for almost two years, I
definitely get the sense that if I am going to make a significant impact on the
world, it would be through my work. The amount of time you can spend dedicated
to things outside of work is limited (and more so if you are married with kids),
and that time is likely not quality in comparison to the hours at work (the
level of exhaustion coming back, the need to multiplex between different
projects, the actual hour and time of day, competing priorities with chores,
etc). In addition, the impact you create at work is compounded by the social
network available to you, the company's resources, and the integration of your
work with that of others. Spending an additional hour at work, if your work is
meaningful, leads to greater returns than working on a project otherwise outside
of work.

This book is targeted more towards people early on in their career, or to those
who haven't even started their career yet (high schoolers and undergraduates),
but focuses more on those who are exceptionally able. It makes sense because you
have more years ahead of you when you're young, and because young people are
more flexible, and those able and privileged enough to consider social impact in
their work (which is literally the tippy-top of [Maslow's heirarchy of
needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs) are the ones
actively considering options for effictive altruism. However, the intersection of
young people who are able enough to apply for and receive a Thiel Fellowship
(one suggestion mentioned in the book) and those who don't know what they wish
to make of their lives may be rather thin. This may lead to unforeseen
consequences; for example, the book quantifies social impact as an aggregate
metric, going so far as to say a dollar will help a poor community in a
third-world country moreso than a poor American city. It gave off the vibe that
because the American poor are 10x wealthier than the global poor, they are not
as worth helping and we should try and bring the averages closer together. I
would say in purely quantitative terms, they are right -- but it fails to
capture qualitative benefits of directly making small impacts and how that
affects your happiness and self-actualization (e.g. ladling soup at a homeless
shelter, or signing up with [MSF](https://www.msf.org/)).

Otherwise, the book provides good advice, such as:

- **Optimize for flexibility**: Do what you are good at so that you aren't boxed
  in your career and your ability to help others, and ideally choose a
  profession and a career path that will give you that flexibility (e.g.
  majoring in Applied Mathematics, and going into the corporate world before
  joining a non-profit).

- **Solve for the bottlenecks**: Social impact is measured in helping each
  person more, and helping more people. Both can be addressed in a scalable
  manner, especially by fixing the things that block others from making their
  own progress. For example, [Karl
  Landsteiner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Landsteiner)'s work on
  distinguishing between blood groups, or [Norman
  Borlaug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug)'s work on introducing
  high-yield grain varieties to developing countries empowered doctors and
  farmers to directly save much more lives.

- **Build things with others**: Most of the career options listed involve some
  level of management, and that's because solutions that scale are generally
  multi-person solutions. It is the product manager that rallies software teams
  and entrepreneurs that start companies that can build a base of influence,
  capital, and intellectual horsepower to tackle the world's largest problems --
  not one guy in a garage.

Fundamentally, the book is a solid read. There are some kernels of interesting
perspectives and options that may open the door to possibilities to those
without such information in the workplace or the field. However, it's not a
Bible of knowledge, and should be treated as one book of many and one method of
many.
