I have two bookshelves at home: one large bookshelf in my living room for my
larger reference set of books, and a much smaller bookshelf in my bedroom for
the books I would want to read again and again. It helps with prioritizing. I
prepopulated my smaller bookshelf with unread books I thought I might want to
keep, and move them to the larger bookshelf if they're not repeats. I think
["80,000 Hours"](/posts/2018/10/07/80000_hours) fits that description. "Deep
Work" doesn't.

For pretty much all of high school and college, which is all the time I've spent
readying myself for the workplace, I was a busybody -- and this is not a
compliment. I remember in high school, I used to memorize the words for each
spelling dictation 20 minutes before the exam, and then dump the knowledge
afterwards to make room for new things to memorize. During undergrad, I used to
browse the web during the time that I was studying, and didn't do as well as I
could or should, which are consequences I am paying to this very day. It
happened because I told myself that I should always be studying, and that no
time should be allocated to rest. I ignored the reality that people _will_ rest
after being pushed to their limits regardless of whether their high-level,
System 2 faculties command them to. What really ended up happening was I was
resting while I was working, and that meant not only did my productivity go down
through the floor, I was altering my brain long-term to not have the
concentration habits I did when I was younger.

Cal Newport understands this, and expresses it very well in his book. He
mentions appreciating the long-term changes to the global economy, which rewards
having and using increasingly complex skills and automating away the boring,
replaceable tasks, as the "Great Restructuring". What's important in this
economy and its evolution is having the ability to learn complex things
extremely quickly (e.g. machine learning academic fundamentals and applications
in 1 month from having no software engineering background). This ability is like
a muscle, and the only way to train it is by "Deep Work", defined as:

> **"The ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding
> task."**

Cal differentiates between four different types of deep work:

- A monastic-type lifestyle, such as that of Donald Knuth, who does not have an
  email address and responds to postal mail every three months

- A "bimodal" or semi-monastic lifestyle, such as that of Adam Grant, the
  professor at Wharton, who may take several months offline to conduct deep
  work, then rejoin the community

- The "rhythmic" lifesytle, like that of Brian Chappell, who works for 90
  minutes every morning before an 8 hour workday

- The "journalistic" lifestyle, where advanced deep work practitioners like
  Walther Issacson can "turn on" the deep work portion of their brain on a dime
  and use any meaningful chunk of time to fall into deep work

Cal also describes the different tradeoffs between these lifestyles, mostly
based on the level of commitment you expect from your routine and the valuable
results the world expects. The easiest routine to get started with appears to be
the "rhythmic" lifestyle, where deep work is eased into your lifestyle with a
predictable routine.

The three big takeaways I got from "Deep Work" would be:

- **Deep work is a connection to the sacred**. In talking about craftsmanship as
  a responsible form of sacredness in individual life, Dreyfus and Kelly argue
  the craftsman "does not generate meaning, but rather cultivates in himself the
  skill of discerning meanings that are already there". It provides an
  alternative to shallow work, detachment, and nihilism, which is always
  soul-crushing.

- **Be lazy**. Because the brain only has a certain amount of directed attention
  available (about 4 hours a day), and because deep work only occurs in large
  intervals, the brain needs time to recharge between each deep work session.
  Otherwise, using your direct attention reserves will interfere with your
  ability to concentrate during your deep work sessions. In addition, problems
  can be tackled both from the conscious and unconscious minds, and different
  perspectives enhance the understanding of a problem (see [Unconscious thought
  theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconscious_thought_theory)).

- **Use productive meditation**. In contrast with mindfulness meditation, where
  you physically do nothing and mentally work to do nothing, productive
  meditation has you physically do something but mentally focus on something
  else. Say walking in a park and thinking about a system design problem. Like
  traditional meditation, you need to be mindful of your mind wandering off, and
  it takes practice to become good at it.

This book was a great buy, and I think I like Cal's writing about as much as
Jason Fried's and David Heinemeier Hansson's. I will look into purchasing that
first book he wrote, ["So Good They Can't Ignore
You"](https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124), and look
forward to the books he will write in the future.
