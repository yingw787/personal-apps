I found this book laying on the shelf at [Amazon Books in
Georgetown](https://www.amazon.com/amazon-books-georgetown-washington-dc/b?ie=UTF8&node=17750349011),
the first or second time that I've been there. What intrigued me about this book
was the opinionated 24-step roadmap, which claimed to denote one path to
entrepreneurial success. The graphics and layout were also pretty attractive
too, and I think I'm [kind of a sucker for that
format](/posts/2018/04/04/rework).

What surprised me about this book what the checklist-like nature of what each
step entails doing. I hate remembering to do things that I could otherwise put
into a checklist (both at work and in personal life), and this kind of format
appeals to me. You could take the advice written in this book and use it as a
kernel to customize a checklist to your particular area of business. It also lists
some hard numbers entrepreneurs should respect, for example:

- For Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) business models, the ratio of the lifetime
  value (LTV) of a customer to the cost of customer acquisition (COCA) should
  be greater than or equal to 3:

  $$ \frac{LTV}{COCA} >= 3 $$

- The actual COCA is usually _10-20x_ initial estimates.

In addition, the book also has some great general advice:

- Optimize the ratio of LTV to COCA. If setting a particular price lowers your
  margin but dramatically decreases the length of your sales cycle, it may be
  worth the tradeoff.

- Market segmentation is critical for price discrimination.

- Select a beachhead market and build plans revolving how to tackle the total
  addressable market (TAM) in the future to maintain focus.

This book was a fun read, with pretty graphics and entertaining stories. It's
also a hard-nosed look at the realities of entrepreneurship.
