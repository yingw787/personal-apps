Yesterday, I got rejected by the Recurse Center.

![rejection](/img/posts/2018/10/09/i_should_fail_more_1.png)

(feel free to open the image in a new tab, the text is a bit small)

I really wanted to get in because I believed if I were to do a sabbatical next
year, being around other really motivated people would help push me get better.

Then I remembered that I explicitly predicated the desire to do a sabbatical on
publishing twelve featured blog posts on our company blog. One blog post a
month. The last one I published was back in May. I haven't published one since
then.

Then I realized that I haven't published a lot of the side projects, or done a
lot of the stuff that I told myself I would do in my [New Year's
Resolutions](/posts/2018/01/01/new_years_resolutions). I've been in the
workforce for two years, and what _do_ I have to show for it? How can I convince
people from my currently exposed work that I deserve further external
investment?

And the answer is, _I can't_. There's _a lot_ of software engineers for the
number of slots being filled, and a lot of those angling for a position either
have a **solid** track record of contributing to open source projects, [making
operating systems](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os), [filing RCE
bugs](https://sites.google.com/site/testsitehacking/-36k-google-app-engine-rce),
writing blog posts, or otherwise demonstrating their skills. I remember one
friend in college saying:

> "Undergrad is likely the hardest part of your career; slightly lower in stress
> would be grad school, and way down the totem pole is working at a company".

I think I'm afraid of failure. And that's why I'm coasting on my Duke pedigree,
my knowledge of Python (picked up at my previous job and only marginally
expanded here), and ended up getting burned on the first thing I pick up. I
haven't even gone on a date -- ever -- and that was the first priority I made
for myself this year.

This isn't a pity party. It's not like anybody shows up.

Seriously though, I think I've had enough failures in my life where I'm not
deathly afraid of doing things. I [skydive](/posts/2018/08/26/i_went_skydiving).
I ask people out. I _can_ do these things. But I don't make failing a regular
occurrence. And I think [that might be what's
missing](https://www.businessinsider.com/spanx-founder-sara-blakely-redefine-failure-2016-10).

I need to fail more often so that:

- **I can overcome my [impostor
  syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome)**: How do you
  identify your limits? When you start failing. I haven't been pushing my
  limits, and that just makes me paranoid that I'm "falling behind everyone
  else because they're all studying". If I started failing more, I would have
  found out how limited my abilities been, and addressed them with discrete
  actionables.

- **I can shorten my [grief
  cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%BCbler-Ross_model)**: It's still
  painful when I fail and takes a week in order to go through (denial -->
  anger --> bargaining --> depression --> acceptance) of whatever I failed at.
  If I ever hope to push really hard in some direction (which is the only way
  to do great things), it has to not hurt while pushing.

- **Ensure that I can trust my mind**: I remember when I suffered through
  depression, I could not trust my brain to make the right decision. That
  paralyzed my decision making and crippled my ability to generate results. If
  my brain tells me, "you're doing great", how can I believe it? The proof has
  to be in the pudding. I also have to make failure a regular part of my life
  so that if I start pushing myself in the future, I can differentiate between
  regular failure and "I am pushing myself too hard and I will start breaking
  down again" kind of failure.

I added to my [productivity tracker](https://www.apalon.com/productive.html) the
weekly habit "What have you tried to fail at this week?" in order to remind
myself to fail more. Hopefully this will result in some accelerated personal
growth in the final months of 2018.
