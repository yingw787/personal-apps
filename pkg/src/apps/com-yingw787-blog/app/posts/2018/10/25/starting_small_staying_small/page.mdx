I'll say this right off the bat: Out of the 56 books I've read since starting my
professional career, this book has easily been the most useful. I think the only
person I've found to be anywhere as helpful might be Gary Bernhardt and his
[Destroy All Software](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts) set of
screencasts.

The striking thing about this book is just how much it does _not_ focus on
computer software. As the book is focused towards software engineers who wish to
be entrepreneurs, it assumes you know software and want to learn about the other
aspects of starting a company, such as the importance of product management and
marketing. It's also striking for how many hard metrics it provides; you need to
launch within six months of having a landing page up and running, your
conversion rate may vary between X%-Y%, etc.

I'm a wantapreneur. I have problems with commitment. If I were to start a
company though, I think this would be the reference book sitting closest to me.

If this book sold for $100 instead of the
[$25](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0615373968/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s02?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
on Amazon, it would still have been worth it.
