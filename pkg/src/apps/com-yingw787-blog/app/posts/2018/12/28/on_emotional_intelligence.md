This collection of essays published in the Harvard Business Review describes the
importance of emotional intelligence and how it impacts businesses financially,
legally, and in other ways. This trait is especially important when somebody is
directing an organization's direction, working in an organization without a
clear command-and-control hierarchy, or dealing with knowledge workers.
Emotional intelligence comes into play at many different levels: from
self-introspection, to dealing with others within the same organization, to
dealing with outsiders (other divisions within the same company, other
companies, and external stakeholders like customers).

There were a number of emotional intelligence notions that I thought I could
apply in day-to-day life:

- **Process fairness**: The notion that people are treated justly, based on
  how much input they have in business decisions, how much weight their input
  has in said decisions, and how those decisions are communicated. [An
  academic study by Duke and Ohio
  State](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2667109?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents)
  put the expected cost savings of practicing process fairness for **$1.28
  million per 100 employees dismissed** in the year 2000 (measuring cost of
  wrongful termination claims). Practicing process fairness can reduce
  employee turnover, boost performance, and increase team cohesion, all of
  which increases organizational fitness.

- **Pattern recognition and emotional tagging**: When encountering situations
  highly similar to those in the past, our [System
  1](/posts/2018/08/19/thinking_fast_and_slow/) may be activated, returning a
  cached result triggering a particular decision to execute. This may be
  disastrous depending on how big the differences are between the mentally
  stored solution and the appropriate one. Emotional information may also be
  tied with factual information, which may generate an inappropriate response
  as well.

- **Emotional resilience**: Possessing a hard-nosed understanding of the
  situation (rather than looking through an optimistic lens), holding a deep
  belief that life is meaningful (and hence giving up is not an option), and
  improvising with the resources at hand are the three defining traits of
  emotional resilience. [Viktor Frankl's authored
  works](/posts/2018/11/24/mans_search_for_meaning/) served as a focal point
  for resilience training.

The book notes several solutions for the described problems at hand, but they
can largely be summarized as "feedback, feedback, feedback". The more feedback
loops there are, and the more types of mediums involved, the better. For
example, feedback loops may entail:

- Recording yourself interacting with others, then playing back the video
  three times: once with audio and video, once with audio turned off to
  examine body and facial movements and gesturing, and once with video turned
  off to pay attention to vocal tone and mood.

- Having a coach or trainer shadow you when interacting with others, and pull
  you aside when a particular behavior should be identified and rectified.

- Instituting organizational processes like steering committees when large,
  impactful decisions are made by leadership to ensure no emotional bias comes
  into play (e.g. when the CEO who was VP of an unprofitable division makes
  the decision to sell or shut down said division), firing jerks, rewarding
  civil behavior, and adding other checks and balances as needed by discovery.

- Receiving [360-degree
  feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/360-degree_feedback) and combining
  that information with self-introspection.

I think this book is chock-full of good advice, but it is a bit academic in
tone. It's also tailored more towards managers, particularly senior managers,
rather than employees and lower-level managers. A useful read with good lessons
to be implemented in time.
