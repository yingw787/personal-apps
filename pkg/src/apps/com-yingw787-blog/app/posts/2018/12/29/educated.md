Tara Westover grew up with a family of survivalists, a father who suffered from
symptoms of bipolar disorder and a mother with an untreated brain injury. Yet
her story of escaping that world to get a Ph.D from Cambridge may be the
survival story of all.

Before reading this book, whenever I heard of kids having difficulty to get an
education, I imagined something like these children in rural China:

![children going to school](/img/posts/2018/12/29/educated_1.jpg)

Which doesn't seem so bad until you realize you're really looking at this:

![children climbing cliff](/img/posts/2018/12/29/educated_2.jpg)

An 800 meter cliff, to be climbed up and down every day.

And yet these kids have what Tara didn't: a facts-based reality with supportive
parents who realized they didn't know everything, and that the outside world
knew more.

Tara's father owned a junkyard, and her mother peddled essential oils. Both
avoided dependence on an outside world they believed to be fallen and would end
soon. They intoned how modern medicine, the government, and even other Mormons
were of the Devil and the Illuminati and should not be trusted. Hence, Tara's
true birthday is unknown even to her, and she did not receive a formal education
until college.

How do you learn when the reality you knew isn't real? When there is no
foundation to set your building blocks? The answer is _with extreme difficulty_.
By buying algebra books, getting trigonometry tutoring from a friend, and daring
to apply to scholarships, Tara got into BYU, then Cambridge, then Harvard.

Even with these setbacks, the true difficulty Tara presents in her memoir is her
difficulty in creating lasting, meaningful relationships with people on the
"outside" while also preserving her relationship to her parents, her siblings
who had listened to them, and her past -- her _home_. Her ignorance of the
Holocaust helped cost her her one friendly acquaintance in a junior-level art
class, and her abysmally poor hygiene habits made working relationships with her
roommates impossible. When she made progress in any of those fields, her parents
shrunk further away, berating her for accepting socialist nonsense and
retreating from God. Eventually, these ties became too great to bear, and Tara
broke off relations with much of her family during her Harvard fellowship.

Tara's story makes me wonder about whether people like her merely escape her
past, or whether it's possible to form a bridge between two worlds. From Tara's
standpoint, her enstrangement from her parents and half her family wasn't
because they weren't educated and she was, or that she accepted outside help and
they didn't. Instead, she realized their emotional manipulation of her and the
resulting realities shifting beneath her feet whenever she came home meant to
cage her when she didn't want to be caged. She couldn't keep her past and her
future together.

Does it have to be this way, for all families? Tara noted her parent's business
was booming now, in part because they sell essential oils as an alternative to
vaccines and Obamacare. How many more families are like Tara's? And how many
more Taras are there? When do you give up trying to save the people you love?

A must-read book into an oft-overlooked section of America. I couldn't put this
one down.
