I wanted to track my sleep patterns over this year in order to try and turn my
sleep clock ahead a bit. At some points in time I didn't get enough sleep and it
impacted my ability to work in the office. I needed to be less of a night owl
and more of an early riser.

While I didn't pay attention to making my data machine-readable for all my other
personal datasets, my sleep log happened to be the lone exception. Life is so
much better with machine readable data. As a data engineer I should know this.
You can get a machine-readable dump of my sleep log
[**here**](/misc/posts/2018/12/31/sleep.csv).

Turns out I had some difficulty plotting this data using Chart.js, and tried to
resort to `pandas` and `matplotlib`. The difficulty is in making a plot with
times on the Y-axis, and drawing data between two particular dates (e.g. 11PM
from one day to 1PM to the next). So instead, I just made a Google Sheets chart
and took a screenshot of it :blush:

So! What can we glean from the sleep log data?

- **There were a number of days where I got out of bed super late**: These
  likely killed a lot of the momentum to build up good habits to wake up
  early. This is partially a result of bringing a phone to bed and partially a
  result for hating whatever I needed to deal with in the day. I need to find
  a better way to record sleep information than my phone, which is highly
  addicting.

- **I am pretty far off from my goal of waking up earlier, but there was some
  degree of improvement later in the year**: I want to wake up at around 6AM
  and devote the best hours of the day towards whatever I need to get done, as
  opposed to what other people want me to get done. I'm about as close to
  falling asleep at 6AM as I am waking up at 6AM. But the small amount of
  drift towards a sane sleep schedule around November may mean there are
  reasons for optimism starting off for 2019 :tada:

- **Overall, the times have been fairly consistent**: Not in small part due to
  me having to hold down a job, and having to arrive on time-ish for that job.
  If I didn't have that, the other factors may skew or end this habit. I do
  want to ensure my sleep patterns are less dependent on external factors
  going forward, though. This is made more difficult by the fact that habits
  are hard to break.
