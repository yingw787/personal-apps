Maybe it was just coincidence that besides ["Crazy Rich
Asians"](/posts/2018/11/23/crazy_rich_asians), the other three books I read
during Thanksgiving break comprised of the Holocaust, cancer, and Machiavelli.
Or maybe I'm a harbinger of toxic negativity (:frowning: which if so I am
actively trying to change). Regardless, one thing I do like about my personality
is its utilitarianism. I like to do things that will be useful in some way, and
I need to see its usefulness before putting my heart into it. I purchased this
book after the 2016 election, because reasons, and because I thought it would be
genuinely informative and entertaining.

After reading it, I'd say it's informative to a degree, but it might be a little
on the dry side, and maybe a bit outdated and out of context for the average
civilian. To its credit, the manual does state how important it is to stay calm,
collected, and focused on the task at hand, keeping in mind your particular
reason to survive. It doesn't really say anything about why you should survive
besides that not doing so violates your [Code of
Conduct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_of_the_United_States_Fighting_Force)
(seriously). It doesn't bother with political correctness at all (e.g. Tsetse
flies, which transmit sleeping sickness, prefer dark-skinned natives to whites),
and sometimes it doesn't have any good advice (e.g. for a skull fracture, handle
the individual gently -- that's it; to be honest I can't do better). It's a
little all over the place in terms of trying to cover everywhere a U.S.
servicemember might need to survive (the Arctic to the Sahara to the Amazon, in
270 pages), and the diagrams on how to build traps and snares aren't as
informative as I would have liked (I don't think I can construct one just by
looking at the picture, and the diagrams don't come from IKEA). This book
clearly serves only as a complement to actual military training, likely more
advanced training, say for the U.S. Marines or Army combat troops. Considering
I'm probably more valuable to the military as an egghead and won't be drafted
for my strong physique (if it ever comes to that point, which I hope to God it
never does), I don't think I'll get this training unless I paid through the nose
for it privately. And if I actually get drafted for combat duty, there really
must be nobody else on this planet left.

There's maybe three heuristics I would encourage people to do if they actually
want to practice what this book preaches:

- **Actually go out and practice these techniques**: Hunting trips, or multi-day
  camping trips with minimal gear, should be a decent, crude substitute for
  actual survival. The _big_ difference is the desperation and the emotional
  distress, which will definitely make a huge impact on your physical
  performance in the field. Keeping your mental cache warm with knowledge of how
  to build a fire with flint and steel, how to gut, butcher, and preserve meat,
  and how to build or seek shelter will come in handy when reducing your stress
  levels. It's definitely not enough to just read.

- **Ease into more and more difficult training**: I like to go shopping at
  Trader Joe's, and I buy a lot of the frozen dinners to keep on hand when I'm
  too busy to cook and don't want to pay out the nose to eat out. Trader Joe's
  is really nice for young professionals because they have these varying levels
  of prepared food: Frozen dinners, then frozen dinners you need to cook in a
  pan, then raw seasoned food you need to cook in a pan, then just raw
  ingredients. Training for survival could be similar; do a number of exhausting
  day hikes, then stay outside on the weekend, then take Thursdays and Fridays
  off every so often, then do a multi-day trip.

- **Try each thing a little bit, then more and more**: One constant heuristic
  this manual preaches that I've read before is when trying new foods (wild
  berries, weird fish, etc.) is to eat a little bit, wait an hour to see if you
  don't die, then eat a little bit more. If you don't die, hooray you discovered
  a new food source! When building a fire, get the initial sparks cozy in a nest
  of tinder, then stack small logs on top of it, moving up until you have a fire
  the size you want (though the manual recommends many small fires vs. one large
  fire).

Now, keep in mind that this book is about _survival_, not _evacuation_. Of
course you should pack a [disaster kit](https://www.ready.gov/build-a-kit) for
the occasional disaster you need to evacuate from. The difference between
survival and evacuation is whether there's a civilization to come back to. The
best way to combat what I was fearing (societal collapse) is to go on the
offensive: tackle the threat and eliminate it before it drives you out your
home. Max Levchin talks about this in [this great article on survivalism I
found](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/01/30/doomsday-prep-for-the-super-rich):

> One measure of survivalism's spread is that some people are starting to speak
> out against it. Max Levchin, a found of PayPal and of Affirm, a lending
> startup, told me, "**It's one of the few things about Silicon Valley that I
> actively dislike -- the sense that we are superior giants who move the needle
> and, even if it's our own failure, must be spared.**"
>
> To Levchin, prepping for survival is a moral miscalculation; he prefers to
> "shut down party conversations" on the topic. "**I typically ask people, 'So
> you're worried about the pitchforks. How much money have you donated to your
> local homeless shelter?' This connects the most, in my mind, to the realities
> of the income gap. All the other forms of fear that people bring up are
> artificial.**" In his view, this is the time to invest in solutions, not
> escape. "**At the moment, we're actually at a relatively benign point of the
> economy. When the economy heads south, you will have a bunch of people that
> are in really bad shape. What do we expect then?**"

Planning for a life of last resorts sucks. Go live, and just keep your thumb on
the pulse of the world.
