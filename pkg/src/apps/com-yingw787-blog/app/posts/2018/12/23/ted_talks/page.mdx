I love TED talks. The speaking format, the wide variety of genres, and the
flawless execution of those speakers on stage always communicate a highly
impactful idea in a refreshing, unique way. Chris Anderson, the curator of TED,
pulls back the curtains to reveal what makes a great talk in his book on public
speaking. Chris and his team gathered lessons from hundreds of rehearsals for
this book, in addition to inviting former TED speakers to contribute to it as
well, and it all shows in the book's quality.

I got a few interesting takeaways:

- **Always focus on the idea:** You can focus on presentation format, talk
  structure, scripting and memorizing and practicing, but at the end of the
  day, if you don't have an _idea worth sharing_, you're a talking head.
  Audiences can forgive momentary lapses in memory, technical difficulties
  driving your talk off course, dress codes, and other perceived slights if
  there's a central idea, well communicated, with a definitive, widespread
  impact.

- **Knowledge can't be pushed into a brain. It has to be pulled in:** This
  means using vernacular your audience understands to form mental building
  blocks, rehearsing in front of test audiences resembling your audience, and
  weaving an emotional connection between your audience and your idea (from
  curiosity/priming, revelation/reason, etc.). Your audience has a default
  emotional wall; you must lower it for the knowledge you wish to transfer to
  become important and prioritized in their minds.

- **You will only cover as much ground as you can dive into in sufficient
  depth to be compelling:** Bring new and different insights to the table
  require going in depth. Bringing the talk around a single in-depth idea
  (e.g. bacteria hunt in packs, we have a psycological immune system) gives
  the audience a bigger reward for diving in.

Public speaking is a skill rarely mastered or practiced yet richly rewarded. All
multi-person human achievements have taken leadership and inspiration. If you
wish to lead, you'll want to learn public speaking, and you'll want to pick up
this book.
