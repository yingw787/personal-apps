Really proud of myself for this and wanted to share. I also purchased a lifetime
membership for Calm during their Black Friday sale for $149.99, only the second
time I've purchased a lifetime membership for anything besides Plex (which I
don't actually use all that much, honestly). If you haven't checked out Calm, it
will not disappoint.
