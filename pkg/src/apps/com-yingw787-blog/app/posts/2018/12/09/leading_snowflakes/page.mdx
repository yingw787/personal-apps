I don't think I've reviewed an e-book in a while; last one might be Edmond Lau's
"The Effective Engineer". I generally prefer paper books for the ability to
easily add unstructured annotations, and find the medium easier on the eyes
after 8 hours or so staring at a computer screen. I wanted to read "Leading
Snowflakes" because I thought it would give good tips on what good engineering
management looks like. Oren offers a good number of specific suggestions, which
overlap with the content on [Software Lead
Weekly](http://softwareleadweekly.com/), "The Effective Engineer", and others
touch upon. I thought I would add some heuristics that might roughly map to what
they are saying:

- **Engineering management is _not_ engineering**. It is its own separate career
  path, let alone a set of tasks to do, and it's impossible to be an engineer
  and be an effective engineering manager at the same time. Things like tying
  engineering to business impact, ensuring communications between engineering
  and other departments remains open and productive, and recruiting are full
  time jobs.

- **Engineering management is a highly active process**. Passive management
  doesn't work because entropy is the natural state of things. Code becomes
  crufty and the state of the art increasingly leaves you behind, people become
  bored and restless, and corporate politics increase interdivision and
  intradivision suspcisions and reduce social trust and communications. These
  are constant burning fires that must be addressed and looked out for. A good
  analogy of this may be pipelines, where material is constantly moving, or
  static and the pipeline becomes crufty and requires replacement or
  maintenance. Formulating processes to keep these fires under control is key to
  success as an engineering manager.

- **Make sure you help, and not hurt, people when doing things**. Good managers
  place their subordinates and their interests first; knowing what that means
  and acting on that knowledge takes time, practice, and introspection. At the
  very minimum, it means not being the performance bottleneck of the team (e.g.
  not requiring that every purchase order must be signed off on no matter the
  dollar cost), and at best, it means going around and relieving the performance
  bottlenecks of the team (e.g. ensuring that engineers have the correct system
  permissions on AWS for their job).

This e-book seemed a little on the expensive side (may be a volume thing), but I
think it's a good show of support for self-publishing and contains good content.
It is a good buy.
