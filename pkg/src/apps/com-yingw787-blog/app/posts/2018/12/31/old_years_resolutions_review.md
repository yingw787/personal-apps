Well this year I met only a smattering of my original New Year's Resolutions
from earlier this year, [described in this
post](/posts/2018/01/01/new_years_resolutions/). Let's take a stroll down memory
lane and see what I planned for myself.

Priority: **High**

- **<span style="color:orange">Go on a date (PARTIALLY MEETS
  EXPECTATIONS)</span>**: So I actually did have one date lined up _the day I
  was going to fly out to Michigan for Christmas_ -- literally the morning of.
  That's the degree to which I procrastinated. The date fell through due to
  scheduling conflicts, like two other dates I had scheduled with two other
  people: one on the last day of classes at Duke, and one in high school (that
  I still regret to this day). Not to worry too much, though; since the ball
  is rolling they should happen early next year.

  The ukelele has been sitting out on my plastic table for about a year now,
  and I haven't really touched it. Suffice to say I still don't know how to
  play ukelele.

  Dancing, I went to one salsa dancing class at Cafe Citron for a Meetup late
  last year but didn't do much otherwise. So my dancing skills are still
  slowly atrophying.

  Knitting, I haven't done at all. Don't know and never knew how to knit (a
  bad thing if you're wearing socks and shirts with holes in them).

- **<span style="color:red">Become noticeably more fit, especially around my
  chest and my midsection (DOES NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS)</span>**: I did go
  running with a running club based out of Clarendon, but I don't think I
  jived with the social scene there and eventually pulled tendons in my legs
  and the colder weather, along with missed dates, got me out of the habit. I
  did sign up for a gym membership, and I have been going at least once a
  week (at least whenever I am not traveling), but with no noticeable physical
  change, which is hugely disappointing. Of course, abs are made in the
  kitchen, and this is likely more of an issue with nutrition and setting a
  routine.

  One good thing I did do this year is record every day I am supposed to do
  workouts in a planner, even the days I skip. In addition, I also make sure
  to do ten push ups every day, which is absolutely nothing in terms of
  physical fitness, but does keep a skeleton routine alive and prioritized in
  my head.

- **<span style="color:red">Learn to cook well (DOES NOT MEET
  EXPECTATIONS)</span>**: With increased time dedicated to studying, and with
  no routine in place to schedule meal prepping, I gradually increased the
  frequency where I ate out over the course of this year. Not only did this
  likely burn a pretty large hole in my pocket financially, but I fear I may
  have acquired a taste for eating out and don't know if I can fully
  transition back to cooking.

  One good thing I did do is discover Trader Joe's and its frozen foods
  section, so many times I would buy a pack of frozen edamame or something and
  cook it with a little salt in my rice cooker, or defrost some meatballs in
  some tomato sauce. Frozen foods have their place in my mind now, especially
  frozen vegetables, since washing and prepping vegetables is very
  time-consuming for me.

Priority: **Medium-High**:

- **<span style="color:red">Go to a software conference (DOES NOT MEET
  EXPECTATIONS)</span>**: It simply did not happen. I _did_ purchase early
  bird tickets to PyCon 2019, so that _is_ happening this year no matter what.
  I may go to another conference like [!!Con](http://bangbangcon.com/) or
  [RustConf](https://rustconf.com/), but in order for that to happen I'd have
  to probably prepare more (learn a new programming language and use it)
  because I'm definitely paying my own way as there's no educational budget
  available and I have to expect to get a solid return on investment for me to
  make that initial commitment.

- **<span style="color:red">Create 3 software products for my personal use
  (DOES NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS)</span>**: Yeah no, this didn't happen either. I
  think my mistake is thinking I need to make a product or do nothing at all,
  and I ended up doing nothing at all. Even with a good manager and a strictly
  enforced 40 hour workweek, I still had other commitments like going to the
  gym (2 hours including showering), other meetups like writing, and chores.
  Those are execuses though, and this is likely more of a time management
  issue, as I definitely could have spared at least 30 minutes a day working
  on something or other.

  One good thing I did like is how I spun up [Bytes by
  Ying](https://bytes.yingw787.com/) and separated out my engineering content
  from my personal blog content. That site has analytics and mailing lists and
  better support for engineering-related material. I wouldn't count this as
  part of a software project because the amount of coding required was
  trivial.

- **<span style="color:orange">Fill in the gaps in my computer science
  education (PARTIALLY MEETS EXPECTATIONS)</span>**: I took and am still
  taking a whack at this problem by starting to read through CLRS, but I still
  haven't covered most of my algorithms knowledge to working proficiency, and
  I haven't learned too much about operating systems yet. About the only good
  thing this year in terms of moving towards this direction is how after
  switching companies, everything (and I mean _everything_) is Linux. And with
  macOS's coming (came?) downfall and well, Windows being Windows, having a
  strong proficiency in Linux is a step up from last year. Another good thing
  that happened is how I'm trying to craft incentives for myself to do
  difficult things like read computer science textbooks from front to back,
  like going to a coffee shop and buying lattes for myself every three hours
  until I finish the section I wanted to get through.

Priority: **Medium**

- **<span style="color:red">Speak at a software conference (DOES NOT MEET
  EXPECTATIONS)</span>**: Did not happen. I think I only went to one DC Hack
  and Tell (which was a blast) but didn't have anything to present at that
  one. Ultimately, I think this is probably the best place to start off with
  in terms of public speaking and conferences in the D.C. area, so it's not a
  matter of finding another group, but committing to the one I already know
  about.

- **<span style="color:red">Earn $100 from a software product that I make
  myself (DOES NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS)</span>**: Yea no, not gonna happen until
  I have a software product in hand. This is probably going to tie into next
  year's resolutions.

- **<span style="color:green">Read at least one book every two weeks (EXCEEDS
  EXPECTATIONS)</span>**: I read a total of **31** books last year, fewer than
  the **37** I read last year, but well more than one book every two weeks. In
  addition, this time around I also wrote book reviews for all the books I
  read (although these reviews are so bad they border on shitposts). Right now
  it's a _very_ spiky pattern: I'd read one large book that takes me several
  months to get through, then go home for break or something and read one book
  every day for a week. This means my ability to read larger books (more than
  300 pages and with harder technical content) is still limited.

- **<span style="color:red">Read at least one research paper and understand it
  every two weeks (DOES NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS)</span>**: This did not happen.
  I still have the printout of one paper on updating software for distributed
  systems on my microwave. I did find a fairly good cache of software papers
  at Google AI, located [here](https://ai.google/research/pubs/). I think I
  will just work through these papers to start off with if I continue to
  pursue this resolution, instead of the horrifyingly large archive on ACM or
  ArXiV or whatnot. Generally, these papers (especially the ones on software
  architecture and systems design) should be fairly good.

- **<span style="color:red">Peruse 3 well-known codebases and be able to
  explain how they work (DOES NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS)</span>**: This did not
  happen. I am planning on reading the online book [The Architecture of Open
  Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html) and reviewing the
  codebases referenced therein, and I think I will commit to helping develop
  an open source project at PyCon, so this is something I will probably at
  least partially do next year.

- **<span style="color:red">Publish a software engineering book on O'Reilly
  (DOES NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS)</span>**: This did not happen. I think before I
  publish on O'Reilly, I would probably want to publish on Leanpub. Also be
  able to find a good circle of editors and publishers. This wasn't high on my
  list of todos and it dropped over time, so I don't know if this will be a
  thing for next year (unless I am writing to make money, in which case things
  may be different).

- **<span style="color:red">Complete Udemy courses I already have (DOES NOT
  MEET EXPECTATIONS)</span>**: Nope. This frustrates me because I paid money
  for those courses and yet over time, if you don't use them, they become more
  and more deprecated and less and less relevant. I will definitely spend good
  money on education, and I think I will still try and work through these
  courses (and _not forget they exist_), but I will probably be purchasing
  them and completing them one at a time from now on. They're also geared more
  towards beginners, and I would prefer to buy a book or read an online
  tutorial to go at my own pace.

- **<span style="color:red">Get into computer science or data science
  competitions, especially those that are worth the time (DOES NOT MEET
  EXPECTATIONS)</span>**: I don't think this is a viable resolution going
  forward, unless I want to become good enough to do freelancing or get hired
  directly by some company, where I would need proof of comparative quality.

So that's that. Not a great score overall, which is not a great sign for
demonstrating commitment over time.

I think this is the first year I listed publicly my resolutions. So, what did I
learn from doing this?

- **Unimportant resolutions are not resolutions**: Next year, I think I will
  limit the number of resolutions I do to three, and get rid of priorities.
  Too complicated, and if they're important enough they'll be circling in my
  head anyways. I came into my Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks with zero
  expectations, and as a result I got a lot of stuff done. It's ironic, but
  also understandable; if you feel like you're not bound by some prior
  agreement with yourself, the sky's the limit and if you don't fly that high
  you won't flagellate yourself for it.

- **Formulate specific requirements**: The lack of specific requirements
  killed a lot of the initial motivation to get the ball rolling. Because when
  you have to spread yourself too thin and overreach your capabilities,
  nothing gets done. And when nothing gets done, nothing continues to get
  done, and that's the snowball that ends up rolling.

- **The only easy day was yesterday**: A lot of these resolutions I set for
  myself don't really _change_ things in a meaningful way. To really push the
  limits, the resolutions I set should be hard (mentally or emotionally).
  Maybe frame it so that it appears deceptively simple, but meaningful enough
  to change the course of my life. It doesn't have to be big; even setting the
  goal of cooking and meal prepping for myself will save thousands of dollars
  and quite a large percentage of my take-home salary.

- **Closed feedback loops, and hard data, are invaluable**: The purchasing of
  my habit mobile app was probably my best decision of 2018. The introduction
  of feedback loops and some sort of hard check was what got me to actually do
  ten push ups every day, and brush my teeth regularly, and fill out the rest
  of my data sheets like logging my sleep cycles and gratitude journals and
  such. Additional feedback loops, like getting feedback on my writing and
  going to a physical cafe to read difficult material, branch off of that to
  accomplish more specific tasks.

- **I have to work to like myself**: And that's okay. I have to be able to
  forgive myself for past mistakes to really be able to achieve things in the
  present.

- **Interesting people do interesting things**: Doing nothing is boring and
  leads to an unfulfilling life. As long as I don't regret the time I spend
  here on Earth, I think that makes the mark. But that means _doing_ things.

The inflection age is coming up; I'm 24 and apparently people don't change much
after their mid-20s are up. I need to set resolutions to steer myself towards
the life I want, not the life I've been leading (two very different things right
now). So I end 2018 with hope, but also apprehension.
