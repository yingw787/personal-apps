I think if there's one dominant feeling I have for this year, it's regret. I
thought I would do so much more than I actually did. It's not necessarily what I
wanted to do anymore, like when I was younger. It's that the quality of time I'm
spending throughout the day doesn't meet my expectations. I'm spending way, way,
_way_ too much time doing things I don't enjoy, and not only does that cost me
the time to do things I would actually enjoy, it eats into my heart and prevents
me from enjoying things that I otherwise normally would.

I thought a reminder here would help, which is why I copied over a blog post I
saw a few years ago to [its own top-level page](/five_regrets). I think it gives
a very nice kick in the pants, to be used as needed.

Some deficiences I've noticed in myself are:

- **An inability to follow to-do lists very well:** I used
  [todoist](https://todoist.com/?lang=en) in the past, but I never built up the
  habit. I have a habit in my Productive application to write down a todo list
  for the next day, but I rarely follow through. Complex, multi-day endeavors
  (which are the most valuable things to do) are hard for me, for various
  reasons. I think some personal assistance will help, so maybe I will sign up
  for [Boss as a Service](https://bossasaservice.life/).

- **Perhaps the wrong mental model to approach problems:** I love meditating and
  I definitely won't stop, but I think meditation is more of a salve rather than
  a cure. Working out of these problems and fears takes activity, not
  passitivity. I think I need to complement my meditation and Stoicism practices
  with something else, maybe
  [logotherapy](/posts/2018/11/24/mans_search_for_meaning).

- **Less detailed tracking of my day than may be required:** A lot of times I
  spend 10 minutes on Reddit, which is really 2 hours on reddit, which is really
  an entire afternoon. With no interrupts at home to break me away from the
  screen, it's easy to spend too much time on my phone doing useless things. I
  have [Screen
  Time](https://www.pcmag.com/g00/feature/363837/how-to-use-screen-time-in-apple-s-ios-12?i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%3d&i10c.ua=1&i10c.dv=3)
  enabled for Safari, but it's not much use since it can (and is) overriden
  regularly. Maybe a [daily
  journal](http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/)
  will help this.
