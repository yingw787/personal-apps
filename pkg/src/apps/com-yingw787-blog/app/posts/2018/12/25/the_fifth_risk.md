> It is delaying repairs to a tunnel filled with lethal waste until, one day, it

Years ago, when I volunteered at a local hospital in my hometown for high school
service hours, I read on CNN that [39 Special Operations troops lost their lives
in a helicopter
crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Afghanistan_Boeing_Chinook_shootdown).
I was pretty concerned at the time because special forces troops can take twenty
years to train and the loss would severely set back America's capabilities in
prosecuting terrorists. By contrast, the lady at the front desk couldn't have
cared less. "Oh. Well I'm off to buy some sunglasses." Those were her exact
words, burned into my mind. I think that was my first taste of what the average
American thought of their government. It was, as this book states, a
waiter-customer relationship rather than a collective-good relationship. In good
times, it works; in bad times, not so much.

This book, written at a time of heightened awareness towards our government,
deftly deflects some of that precious political capital towards the unseen and
unspoken risks of our future. It's not what we can see that destroys us. We can
face what we see. It's what we can't see that kills us.

From the extremely sophisticated [Metcalf sniper
attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalf_sniper_attack) highlighting just
how vulnerable our electrical grid is, to [trespassing at the Y-12 nuclear
weapons storage
complex](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/us/pacifists-who-broke-into-nuclear-weapon-facility-due-in-court.html?_r=1&ref=atomicweapons)
demonstrating the ease of nuclear terrorism on U.S. soil, to the notion that
for-profit weather forecasters like AccuWeather make nonsense predictions for
money beyond the information they recieve from the National Weather Service (I
honestly thought they just served ads...), the depopulation of the civil
services responsible for those issues and the politicization of those
governmental shells left behind produce unquantifiable risks shrouded in the fog
of war. This should be the primary concern of every American (and really, every
citizen of any nation where this happens).
