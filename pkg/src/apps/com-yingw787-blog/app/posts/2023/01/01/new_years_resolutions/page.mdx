I think with every New Year’s Resolution, I get better and better at defining
ways and means for those resolutions to work towards what I truly value, and in
the end, work out successfully. In 2018, I set for myself a “medium priority
goal” of “read at least one research paper and understand it every two weeks”.
I’m looking back and chuckling at how I designed that goal (I didn’t) and how it
was structured (it wasn’t) and what impact that would have had on me if it did
work out (minimal).
