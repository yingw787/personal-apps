This is my personal blog, where I publish book reviews, ruminate on aspects of
my life, and generally voice my internal monologue.

<div className="flex w-full justify-center">
  <img
    src="/images/picture_happycat_cropped.jpg"
    className="aspect-square rounded-2xl bg-zinc-100 object-cover dark:bg-zinc-800 max-h-[100px]"

If you're not me and you're coming here from somewhere else (which could be
happening since I find this blog above [my professional
techblog](https://bytes.yingw787.com) when I search my username on Google),
there are two important differences:

- The posts here are much more unvarnished than the posts on my tech blog, as I
  spend far less time preparing each one. It's more of a stream of consciousness
  rather than well-executed checkpoints.

- I don't keep Google Analytics on this blog, and I never will. This so I can
  use this blog as my personal scratchpad.
