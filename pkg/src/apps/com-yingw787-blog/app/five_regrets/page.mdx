**From [Collective
Evolution](https://www.collective-evolution.com/2013/04/27/the-top-5-regrets-of-the-dying/):**

A pallative nurse recorded the most common regrets of the dying and put her
findings into a book called [_"The Top Five Regrets of the
Dying"_](http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Top-Five-Regrets-Dying/dp/1848509995/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1367096226&sr=8-1&keywords=top+regrets+of+the+dying).
It's not surprising to see what made the list, as they are all things that touch
each of our lives as we struggle to pay attention to and make time for the
things we truly love. Below is the list of each regret along with an excerpt
from the book.
