From ["The Confidence Gap", by Russ
Harris](http://thehappinesstrap.com/upimages/complete_worksheets_for_The_Confidence_Gap.pdf):

> Values are your heart’s deepest desires for how you want to behave as a human
> being. Values are not about what you want to get or achieve; they are about
> how you want to behave or act on an ongoing basis.
>
> There are literally hundreds of different values, but below you’ll find a list
> of the most common ones. Probably, not all of them will be relevant to you.
> Keep in mind there are no such things as ‘right values’ or ‘wrong values’.
> It’s a bit like our taste in pizzas. If you prefer ham and pineapple but I
> prefer salami and olives, that doesn’t mean that my taste in pizzas is right
> and yours is wrong. It just means we have different tastes. And similarly, we
> may have different values. So read through the list below and write a letter
> next to each value: V = Very important, Q = Quite important, and N = Not so
> important; and make sure to score at least ten of them as Very important.
