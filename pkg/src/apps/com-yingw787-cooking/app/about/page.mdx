This site records my empirically tested recipes for my own uses. Nothing more.

If you're faithfully following a recipe posted here and have trouble, it's on
me, not you. Please [email me](mailto:me@yingw787.com) with a description of
your trouble so that I can add additional notes where needed. I'll probably need
them too.
