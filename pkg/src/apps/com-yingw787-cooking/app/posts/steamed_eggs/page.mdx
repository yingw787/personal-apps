# Ingredients:

-   2 large brown eggs
-   Salt
-   1/3 cup water
-   Water for steaming
-   Sesame oil

# Tools:

-   Chopsticks
-   Mixing bowl
-   Wok
-   Lid for wok
-   1/3 cup measuring cup
-   Regular ceramic bowl
-   Wok steamer rack
-   Strainer
-   Stove

# Process:

-   Place **wok steamer rack** into **wok**.
-   Using sink, add **water for steaming** into **wok** until water level
    matches top of **wok steamer rack**.
-   Place **wok** on **stove**.
-   Place **lid for wok** on **wok**.
-   Turn **stove** on and leave until **water for steaming** is boiling.

__________

-   Crack the **eggs** into the **mixing bowl**.
-   Using **chopsticks**, take out the white stringy thing from each egg.
-   Using **chopsticks**, beat the egg into a uniform mixture. There should be
    bubbles from beating air into the **eggs**.
-   Add **salt** into egg mixture. Egg mixture should darken in color.
-   Using **1/3 cup measuring cup**, add **1/3 cup water** to egg mixture.
-   Using **chopsticks**, beat water and egg mixture until uniform.
-   Using **strainer**, strain water and egg mixture into **regular ceramic
    bowl**. This removes unbeaten chunks and bubbles.

__________

-   When **water for steaming** is boiling, remove **lid for wok**.
-   Place **regular ceramic bowl** with water and egg mixture onto **wok steamer
    rack**.
-   Place **lid for wok** back on.
-   Steam for 10 minutes.

__________

-   After eggs are cooked, remove **lid for wok**.
-   Take **regular ceramic bowl** with steamed eggs and leave to cool.
-   Add **sesame oil** on top for seasoning and taste.

# Notes:

-   I haven't figured out how to make the eggs cook uniformly. Circular ring of
    bubbles appears where the stove flames are underneath. Straining does help,
    but since I'm filling water to the top of the steamer rack, it may conduct
    heat directly from the stove (where the flames are arranged in a circle),
    and not cooking via steam. I may reduce the amount of water added to see
    whether that helps the eggs cook more uniformly.

# Updates:

-   **March 25th, 2020:** Tried this recipe, but changed ceramic bowl to glass
    flat-bottomed bowl. Pre-heated using high heat, 10 minutes on high heat,
    didn't get rid of all the bubbles, and strained out any solids. Eggs were
    extremely fluffy and didn't have much water content. This may be an issue
    with leaving it on high heat for 10 minutes.

    Things to consider next time:

    -   Wrap individual glass bowl with saran wrap to trap water content within
        the bowl itself.

    -   Tuning heat from high to low/medium to avoid frothing the egg/water
        mixture.

    -   Tuning timer from 10 minutes to 6 minutes to reduce time cooking.

    -   Pre-heating using low/medium heat instead of high heat.
